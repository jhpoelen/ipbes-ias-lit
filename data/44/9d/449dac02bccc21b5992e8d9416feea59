Biases, gaps and uncertainties in plant occurrence information remain a central problem in ecology and conservation, but these limitations remain largely unassessed globally. In this synthesis, we propose a conceptual framework for analysing gaps in information coverage, information uncertainties and biases in these metrics along taxonomic, geographical and temporal dimensions, and apply it to all c. 370 000 species of land plants. To this end, we integrated 120 million point-occurrence records with independent databases on plant taxonomy, distributions and conservation status. We find that different data limitations are prevalent in each dimension. Different metrics of information coverage and uncertainty are largely uncorrelated, and reducing taxonomic, spatial or temporal uncertainty by filtering out records would usually come at great costs to coverage. In light of these multidimensional data limitations, we discuss prospects for global plant ecological and biogeographical research, monitoring and conservation and outline critical next steps towards more effective information usage and mobilisation. Our study provides an empirical baseline for evaluating and improving global floristic knowledge, along with a conceptual framework that can be applied to study other hyperdiverse clades.",

In this context, the family Cactaceae is particularly challenging because it is considered the fifth most threatened large taxonomic group in the world; several species are among the most widespread and damaging invasive species; and Cactaceae is one of the most popular horticultural plant groups. Based on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and the 11 largest online auction sites selling cacti, we documented the international cactus trade. To provide an in-depth look at the dynamics of the industry, we surveyed the businesses involved in the cactus trade in South Africa (a hotspot of cactus trade and invasions). We purchased seeds of every available species and used DNA barcoding to identify species to the genus level. Although <20% of this trade involved threatened species and <3% involved known invasive species, many species were identified by a common name. However, only 0.02% of the globally traded cacti were collected from wild populations. Despite a large commercial network, all South African imports (of which 15% and 1.5% were of species listed as threatened and invasive, respectively) came from the same source. With DNA barcoding, we identified 24% of the species to genus level. Based on our results, we believe that if trade restrictions are placed on the small proportion of cacti that are invasive and there is no major increase in harvesting of native populations, then the commercial trade in cactus poses a negligible environmental threat. However, there are currently no effective methods for easily identifying which cacti are traded, and both the illicit harvesting of cacti from the wild and the informal trade in invasive taxa pose on-going conservation challenges.",

We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications on non-native herpetofauna, to assess the information base available for assessing risks of future invasions, resulting in 836 relevant papers. The taxonomic and geographic scope of the literature was also compared to a published database of all known invasions globally. We found 1,116 species of herpetofauna, 95% of which were present in fewer than 12 studies. Nearly all literature on the invasion ecology of herpetofauna has appeared since 2000, with a strong focus on frogs (58%), particularly cane toads (Rhinella marina) and their impacts in Australia. While fewer papers have been published on turtles and snakes, proportionately more species from both these groups have been studied than for frogs. Within each herpetofaunal group, there are a handful of well-studied species: R. marina, Lithobates catesbeianus, Xenopus laevis, Trachemys scripta, Boiga irregularis and Anolis sagrei. Most research (416 papers; 50%) has addressed impacts, with far fewer studies on aspects like trade (2%). Besides Australia (213 studies), most countries have little location-speciﬁc peer-reviewed literature on non-native herpetofauna (on average 1.1 papers per established species). Other exceptions were Guam, the UK, China, California and France, but even their publication coverage across established species was not even. New methods for assessing and prioritizing invasive species such as the Environmental Impact Classiﬁcation for Alien Taxa provide useful frameworks for risk assessment, but require robust species-level studies. Global initiatives, similar to the Global Amphibian Assessment, using the species and taxonomic groups identiﬁed here, are needed to derive the level of information across broad geographic ranges required to apply these frameworks. Expansive studies on model species can be used to indicate productive research foci for understudied taxa.",

Many of the best documented cases involve the massive invasions of North America by plant and animal taxa native to Europe. In this study, we use DNA barcoding to survey the occurrence and genetic structure of two major groups of soil invertebrates in both their native and introduced ranges: Collembola and earthworms. Populations of ten species of earthworms and five species of Collembola were barcoded from both continents. Most of these species exhibited a similar genetic structure of large and stable populations in North America and Europe, a result supporting a scenario of multiple invasions. This was expected for earthworm species involved in human economic activities, but not foreseen for Collembola species de facto unintentionally introduced. This study also establishes that invasive species surveys employing DNA barcoding gain additional resolution over those based on morphology as they allow evaluation of cryptic lineages exhibiting different invasion histories.",

Ecology textbooks (e.g., Ricklefs 1984, Krebs 1985, Begon et al. 1990) summarise these important interactions as intra- and interspecific competition for abiotic and biotic resources, predation, parasitism and mutualism. Conspicuously lacking from the list of key processes in most text books is the role that many organisms play in the creation, modification and maintenance of habitats. These activities do not involve direct trophic interactions between species, but they are nevertheless important and common. The ecological literature is rich in examples of habitat modification by organisms, some of which have been extensively studied (e.g. Thayer 1979, Naiman et al. 1988).",

            "abstractNote": "Aim The transport of organisms in ships’ ballast tanks is a dominant vector for aquatic invasions worldwide. Until recently, efforts to manage this vector have overlooked the potential transport of invertebrate resting stages in the residual waters and sediments within emptied ballast tanks, i.e. NOBOB (‘No Ballast On Board’) tanks. The resting stages (statoblasts) of freshwater bryozoans are often buoyant and locally abundant and thus can be taken up easily during ballasting operations. They are also resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can generate new colonies after being dormant for decades; as such, they would likely remain viable propagules after lengthy transport in ship ballast tanks. This study quantified the occurrence of freshwater bryozoan statoblasts in ballast tank sediments of transoceanic ships. Location North American Great Lakes. Methods We quantified the frequency of occurrence, abundance and diversity of bryozoans (as statoblasts) in residual sediment samples taken from 51 NOBOB tanks of 33 transoceanic ships visiting the Great Lakes from 2000 to 2002. Results Our study identified 11 species, comprising nearly 12% of the total number of freshwater bryozoans known worldwide. These include two exotic species unrecorded in the Great Lakes (Fredericella sultana and Lophopus crystallinus), an exotic species already established in the region (Lophopodella carteri) and three cosmopolitan species (Plumatella casmiana, P. fungosa and P. repens). Our estimates suggest that a ship with NOBOB tanks may carry up to 106 statoblasts. Main conclusions The discovery of species unrecorded in the Great Lakes and the potentially large numbers of statoblasts being transported in ship ballast tanks indicate a significant risk of new species introductions. Furthermore, the presence of cosmopolitan species and an exotic species already established in the Great Lakes suggests the strong possibility of cryptic invasions via the introduction of exotic genotypes.",

            "abstractNote": "Many seaweed species (primary rafters) float at the sea surface and travel with marine currents after detachment from benthic habitats. Various studies have confirmed that dispersal via floating sporophytes and/or gametophytes influences the phylogeography and genetic population structure of these buoyant seaweeds. In addition, non-buoyant seaweeds (secondary rafters) that grow attached to or intermingled with these primary floaters may also become dispersed by rafting on their floating hosts. Here, we examine reports of non-buoyant seaweed species associated with buoyant seaweeds and discuss potential consequences for their phylogeography and/or genetic population structure. We found that mostly red and brown algae have been reported with floating seaweed rafts, most of them growing as epiphytes and some as obligate parasites (e.g. endophytes) that travel with their hosts. Molecular evidence suggests dispersal associated with primary floaters in 16 non-buoyant seaweeds, although colonization of distant sites could also have occurred via other floating substrata such as wood, buoys, and other man-made materials. Transoceanic dispersal has been inferred for non-buoyant seaweeds (for example, Gracilaria chilensis and Capreolia implexa) based on low levels of genetic structure and shared haplotypes among populations separated over vast distances of open ocean (e.g. New Zealand–Chile). Some non-buoyant species suspected or shown to be dispersed by rafting are from intertidal habitats, and these algae can resist physiologically stressful conditions during long trips at the sea surface. However, subtidal and low intertidal non-buoyant species have higher potential to be transported because they cohabit with common raft-forming kelps, often growing on them as epiphytes. We conclude that buoyant seaweeds play an important role in driving the phylogeography, evolution, connectivity and distribution of non-buoyant associated seaweeds. Dispersal of non-buoyant seaweeds via these floating seaweeds may have been underestimated in the past.",

            "abstractNote": "The extent of changes in genetic diversity and life-history traits associated with farming was investigated in the haploid-diploid red alga, Gracilaria chilensis, cultivated in Chile. This alga belongs to one of the most frequently cultivated seaweed genera around the world. Fifteen farmed populations, 11 wild populations, and two subspontaneous populations were sampled along the Chilean coast. The frequency of reproductive versus vegetative individuals and of haploid versus diploid individuals was checked in each population. In addition, the distribution of genetic variation in wild and cultivated populations was analyzed using six microsatellite markers. Our results first demonstrated that farmed populations are maintained almost exclusively by vegetative propagation. Moreover, the predominance of diploid individuals in farms showed that farming practices had significantly modified life-history traits as compared to wild populations. Second, the expected reduction in genetic diversity due to a cultivation bottleneck and subsequent clonal propagation was detected in farms. Finally, our study suggested that cultural practices in the southern part of the country contributed to the spread of selected genotypes at a local scale. Altogether, these results document for the first time that involuntary selection could operate during the first step of domestication in a marine plant.",

            "abstractNote": "The identification of native sources and vectors of introduced species informs their ecological and evolutionary history and may guide policies that seek to prevent future introductions. Population genetics provides a powerful set of tools to identify origins and vectors. However, these tools can mislead when the native range is poorly sampled or few molecular markers are used. Here, we traced the introduction of the Asian seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Rhodophyta) into estuaries in coastal western North America, the eastern United States, Europe, and northwestern Africa by genotyping more than 2,500 thalli from 37 native and 53 non-native sites at mitochondrial cox1 and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci. Overall, greater than 90% of introduced thalli had a genetic signature similar to thalli sampled from the coastline of northeastern Japan, strongly indicating this region served as the principal source of the invasion. Notably, northeastern Japan exported the vast majority of the oyster Crassostrea gigas during the 20th century. The preponderance of evidence suggests G. vermiculophylla may have been inadvertently introduced with C. gigas shipments and that northeastern Japan is a common source region for estuarine invaders. Each invaded coastline reflected a complex mix of direct introductions from Japan and secondary introductions from other invaded coastlines. The spread of G. vermiculophylla along each coastline was likely facilitated by aquaculture, fishing, and boating activities. Our ability to document a source region was enabled by a robust sampling of locations and loci that previous studies lacked and strong phylogeographic structure along native coastlines.",

River runoff has introduced high levels of certain heavy metals and other toxic substances as well as detergents. Ship traffic has led to the introduction of new species, and fishing pressures have also altered the ecology of the area. This paper reviews major ecological changes over the past 40 years. An increase in nutrients has caused eutrophication, with outbursts of phytoplankton blooms and changes in the species composition of these algae. Small-sized zooplankton species and gelatinous zooplankton have become more common, while many of the herbivorous copepods have decreased in abundance or have disappeared. The introduction of the predatory ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in the 1980s has had significant impact on the plankton community and has led to a sharp decline in anchovy stocks. Decreased water transparency has led to a loss of macrophytic algae, except in shallow waters, and to a subsequent decline in the zoobenthos associated with this flora. Eutrophication has also led to decreased oxygen concentrations in the near-bottom water due to large amounts of decomposing phytoplankton, and regions of hypoxia and anoxia now appear on the shelf, with consequent reduction in benthic populations of invertebrates and demersal fish. The numbers of fish species harvested commercially have fallen from 26 to 5, but the total catch has increased, owing to increases in abundance of small fish (e.g., sprat) and horse mackerel, and to increased fishing effort.",

In this study, our own field data and a literature review have been used to get an overview of the history and the present distribution of non-indigenous aquatic plant species in Germany. Results show that the number of non-indigenous aquatic plant species in Germany rose from 1 in 1860 to 12 in 1980, but doubled to 24 during the following 29 years. Thirteen of these species are naturalised in at least one federal state, 11 are only ephemeral. The number of non-indigenous aquatic plant species in the German federal states is significantly correlated with the population size and area. The increase in species number and abundance is probably caused by enhanced trading and increased invasibility of waters by eutrophication/re-oligotrophication and climate change. We propose a trading ban for some highly invasive non-indigenous aquatic species. This will not stop their natural spread, but should reduce the risk of further unintended entry and thus can be a major control factor.",

Rarefaction was used to estimate global Phytophthora species richness. We applied a framework, leveraging geographically and economically biased pathogen data against environmental and socioeconomic metrics to model their distribution. Hierarchical clustering of host and country range allowed characterisation of invasion potential. Phytophthora descriptions rose to 86 by the year 2000, surging to over 180 species to date driven primarily by novel molecular techniques, resulting in a species richness estimate of 326 (95% CI: 274–378). Countries with diverse ecosystems and entrenched agricultural and forestry industries supported by intensive research programmes reported the highest diversity. Constructing principal components from enviro-socioeconomic factors highlighted national data deficits, showing that two-thirds of trading nations have reported lower-than-predicted species numbers. Phytophthora species clustered into two main invasiveness groups as either cosmopolitan generalists or specialists, historically tied to agriculture. Further spread and detection of Phytophthora pathogens are inevitable with increasing global trade, especially in developing and emerging economies. Adoption of best practice diagnostics and enhanced resource and data sharing are crucial for coordinated global pathogen surveillance and biosecurity. This research aimed to test the following hypotheses: •The global distribution of Phytophthora species is associated with environmental, social and economic traits of different country’s.•Models for Phytophthora diversity, incorporating environmental, social and economic characteristics, can be used to predict a countries trade risk.•Phytophthora species biogeography and host range can be used to predict invasiveness and a country’s conduciveness to infection.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions have become a major cause of biodiversity loss. Tracing the origin of the populations of alien species is essential to infer the dispersal pathway and finally to set conservation policies aimed at preventing new introductions. The Italian wall lizard, Podarcis sicula, is one of the reptile species most widely introduced, with allochthonous populations occurring from the United States to Turkey. For some of them, instances of geographic expansion and competition/hybridization with autochthonous Podarcis sp. have been indicated. In the Iberian Peninsula, five introduced populations are known: Lisbon (W Portugal), Noja, Cantabria (N Spain), La Rioja (N Spain) and Almeria (S Spain) and Sant Celoni, Barcelona (NE Spain) while the species now widely ranges Menorca Island in the Balearics. Here we assess the origin of four populations (Barcelona population will not be included) by comparing in a phylogenetic framework the cytochrome b gene sequences of specimens from the introduced and native populations. The results from this study provide evidence for distinct sources, pathways, and timing of introduction in Iberian Peninsula and Balearics by P. sicula from Tuscany, Calabria, Sicily, and Sardinia. This finding underpins the fact that P. sicula holds considerable potential invasiveness and advises for conservation strategies based on a global and preventive plan for avoiding new introductions as well as on eradication and control measures when prevention fails.",

There are thus compelling reasons to under stand, and seek to measure, how communities have changed over both evolution ary (geological) and ecological (historical) time. Vast waves of change have swept across the Earth in the past one to two millennia as waves of humans invaded across the planet in sequential episodes of exploration, colonization, and urbanization. As an expected and inexorable result of human activity, alterations in biodiversity have impacted terrestrial, freshwater, and marine communities. These alterations include the addition of species (invasions), the deletion of spe cies (extinctions), and altered population dynamics (such as decreasing or increasing the abundance of a species, or altering genetic structure). In even seemingly “pristine” areas — such as wave-exposed high-energy rocky intertidal shores — it is no longer tenable to assume that communities and ecosystems have remained unaltered, in part because of supply-side impacts — impacts that are the indirect cascades of human activity originating outside of the area in question (e.g., Butman et al. 1995; Chap. 7, Johnston et al.).",

Understanding the patterns and implications of these distributional changes requires comprehensive information on the geography of introduced species. Current knowledge about the alien distribution of macrofungi is limited taxonomically and temporally, which severely hinders the study of human-mediated distribution changes for this taxonomic group.\n            Here, we present a database on the global alien distribution of macrofungi species. Data on the distribution of alien macrofungi were searched in a large number of data sources, including scientific publications, grey literature and online databases. The database compiled includes 1966 records (i.e. species x region combinations) representing 2 phyla, 7 classes, 22 orders, 82 families, 207 genera, 648 species and 31 varieties, forms or subspecies. Dates of introduction records range from 1753 to 2018. Each record includes the location where the alien taxon was identified and, when available, the date of first observation, the host taxa or other important information. This database is a major step forward to the understanding of human-mediated changes in the distribution of macrofungal taxa.",

Its members' abundance, occurrence in exposed positions, and bright red colour make it one of the most eye-catching species of northern Chile. The description is based on 74 specimens collected between 1975 and 2001, and on live observations of several hundred animals in their habitats and in aquaria. The natural microhabitats are positions exposed to currents but protected from surge surf, ranging from tide pools down to depths of 16 m. In 1998, the southern distribution limit was 37 °S, the southernmost extent of the southerly Chile Coastal Countercurrent. The species is similar to Anemonia natalensis and Pseudactinia varia from South Africa. The most distinctive features of A. alicemartinae n. sp. are its bipartite acrorhagi on the margin, uniform red colour, and marks from frequent longitudinal fission. Bud-like structures were observed in two specimens. Evidence of frequent fission and the absence of fertile males in the sample indicate a predominance of asexual reproduction in the population. The fact that such a conspicuous species was not reported in previous surveys of Chilean sea anemones suggests that it has been increasing in abundance and/or expanding its range during the last 50 years. Reasons for this may be human impact on benthic communities or recent introduction of this species into the area.",

Our current agricultural systems — with emphasis on intensive monoculture practices — and globalized markets drive the emergence and spread of new pathogens and problematic traits, such as fungicide resistance. Climate change further promotes the emergence of pathogens on new crops and in new places. Here we review the factors affecting the introduction and spread of pathogens and current disease control strategies, illustrating these with the historic example of the Irish potato famine and contemporary examples of soybean rust, wheat blast and blotch, banana wilt and cassava root rot. Our Review looks to the future, summarizing what we see as the main challenges and knowledge gaps, and highlighting the direction that research must take to face the challenge of emerging crop pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "Knowledge of the status of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) in temperate southeastern Pacific countries (Chile and Peru) is incipient. Nevertheless, at least in Chile, the problem has recently been addressed by taxonomists and ecologists (e.g. Baez et al. 1998; Gajardo and Laikre 2003; Castilla et al. 2005; Camus 2005). While numerous NIS have been intentionally introduced for aquaculture purposes (e.g. Crassostrea gigas, Haliotis rufescens, in both Chile and Peru, and various salmonid species in Chile) there are few studies that have made an explicit examination of the marine environment for the presence of NIS. In Chile, there is a large work-force of researchers studying marine environments for other purposes, and from this assemblage of individuals only a few reports have been made regarding abundant or aggressive exotic species: currently only one thriving invader is known: Codium fragile ssp. tomen-tosoides. In this sense, it appears that Chile, and probably Peru, may be relatively “more pristine” than other coasts in terms of the presence of conspicuous, highly invasive NIS. Nevertheless, the status of non-invasive and cryptogenic NIS in these countries still needs to be fully evaluated. If these marine environments actually are less invaded than other parts of the world it is important to take action now to prevent future introductions, and to study the factors that may limit exotic species introductions and/or their spread. In this chapter our aims are threefold: (1) to discuss the state of knowledge of marine NIS in Chile and report on preliminary evidence from Peru; (2) to provide the most current listing of marine NIS in these countries (Chile and Peru), with information on exotic species' distributions in Chile, the most probable introduction pathway(s) and donor area(s), and known or potential ecological, economic and conservation effects; (3) to discuss the current legislative status of NIS in Chile and make recommendations for further studies in this country based on experiences from other parts of the world.",

The study focused on the Bornholm Basin, which serves as the major spawning ground for cod and sprat, the commercially most important fish stocks in the Baltic. The distribution pattern of M. leidyi revealed a substantial overlap with cod eggs. The observed predation of M. leidyi on eggs has the potential to alter the recruitment success of cod, which is the top predator in the system and, thus, to change the Baltic food-web structure.",

            "abstractNote": "This chapter deals with fungi in the broad sense, i.e. organisms studied by mycologists, including species classified within three different eukaryotic kingdoms: Eumycota, Chromista (or Stramenipila) and Protozoa (Whittaker 1969; Cavalier-Smith 1986; Worral 1999). Lichen forming fungi are considered in Essl and Lambdon (2009).Fungi are a major component of biodiversity on Earth, as the second largest group of Eukaryotes, after insects. The number of fungal species has been estimated to be at least 1.5 million, but less than 10% have been described (Hawksworth 2001). Fungi are inconspicuous organisms and have been far less studied than mammals or vascular plants. This also applies to invasion ecology: fungi are usually poorly, if at all, represented in alien species databases, with the exception of a few well-known examples of plant or animal pathogens. In particular, few comprehensive national checklists have been published for Europe (see below). The reasons for this low representation are most likely due to a poor knowledge of this group of organisms rather than a low invasion success (Desprez-Loustau et al. 2007). When undescribed species are found, how likely is it that they are native to the geographic location of their first record? The species concept itself is not easily handled in fungi. Fungal taxonomy has been evolving rapidly over the recent years, in particular with the use of molecular tools and phylogenetic analysis. This can be illustrated by the fact that more than 50% of the fungal species in the dataset compiled in DAISIE were described (or subjected to taxonomic revision) after 1950, and almost 20% only in the 2000s. Many fungal species previously defined on the grounds of morphology (or of symptoms on host plant for pathogens) have been shown to be a complex of several cryptic species differing in their ecology, and especially in their geographic range (Pringle et al. 2005). A recent example is Mycosphaerella pini, a foliar pathogen of pines, which was shown to be a complex of two phylogenetic species, with one found worldwide, while the other is restricted to the North-Central USA (Barnes et al. 2004). The poor knowledge in the biogeography of fungi can make it difficult to determine what is an alien species. Within the DAISIE dataset, more than 30% of fungal species are considered as cryptogenic, i.e., of unknown origin. New approaches, including phylogeography, might provide clues on the native range of species. For example, Phytophthora ramorum, recently discovered both in Europe and North America, is assumed to be alien in both regions, on the basis of a multilocus analysis demonstrating an extremely narrow genetic structure, most likely explained by the introduction of a few closely related genotypes (Ivors et al. 2006).",

            "abstractNote": "The biogeography of fungi is poorly understood and a species in a novel location may be an introduction or an endemic newly identified within its native range. Using the literature of Amanita phalloides as a case study, we aim to illustrate both the limited utility of the historical record in establishing ectomycorrhizal (EM) species as introduced or invasive, and the difficulty of using modern records to establish a current biogeography. Amantia phalloides, the death cap mushroom, is deadly. It is a notorious fungus with a rich literature. Historical records can be used to explore the species’ distribution in North America, where the earliest publication on A. phalloides dates to 1834, and four different authors identified it as growing in California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Maryland before 1910. In contrast, by mid-century field guides listed A. phalloides as rare on the West Coast and absent from the East Coast. In modern literature A. phalloides is described as a recently introduced and currently invasive species. The contradictions raise two questions: First, is A. phalloides an exotic to North America, and second, can early records be used to delineate the native distribution of any other less infamous EM fungus? We argue that confusion on the introduced status and biogeography of A. phalloides, and perhaps other fungi, is the direct result of shifting species concepts. When publications include an explicit species concept they can be used to establish A. phalloides as an introduction, for example on the East Coast of North America and in Australia. When species concepts are vague the literature is not useful and cannot be used to determine A. phalloides as an introduction, for example on the West Coast of North America or in Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "In this paper we propose a checklist of 14 species of exotic seaweeds on the Chilean coast, and three species which, being native to the Chilean coast, have been introduced in areas outside their natural range. This list was compiled from previously published checklist, debugged the misidentified records, and incorporating new ones. The distribution of exotic seaweeds is not homogeneous along the coast, but it is concentrated in areas near ports and aquaculture centers. Most species display a fairly bounded distribution, and only four tend to invade (i.e., increase its range of distribution over time). However, considering that most introductions are recent (the last 60 years) and the positive relationship between amplitude of the distribution range and residence time of species on the Chilean coast, we suggest that some of these species may be in an expansion phase, which would explain its restricted distribution. This work not only updates the information related to exotic seaweed on the Chilean coast, but also allows us to understand the invasion process, through the analysis of the patterns described in these systems.",

Hybrid species have previously been identified in at least six of the 12 phylogenetic clades. These hybrids can potentially infect a wider host range and display enhanced vigour compared to their progenitors.\n              Phytophthora\n              hybrids therefore pose a serious threat to agriculture as well as to natural ecosystems. Early and correct identification of hybrids is therefore essential for adequate plant protection but this is hampered by the limitations of morphological and traditional molecular methods. Identification of hybrids is also important in evolutionary studies as the positioning of hybrids in a phylogenetic tree can lead to suboptimal topologies. To improve the identification of hybrids we have combined genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and genome size estimation on a genus-wide collection of 614\n              Phytophthora\n              isolates. Analyses based on locus- and allele counts and especially on the combination of species-specific loci and genome size estimations allowed us to confirm and characterize 27 previously described hybrid species and discover 16 new hybrid species. Our method was also valuable for species identification at an unprecedented resolution and further allowed correct naming of misidentified isolates. We used both a concatenation- and a coalescent-based phylogenomic method to construct a reliable phylogeny using the GBS data of 140 non-hybrid\n              Phytophthora\n              isolates. Hybrid species were subsequently connected to their progenitors in this phylogenetic tree. In this study we demonstrate the application of two validated techniques (GBS and flow cytometry) for relatively low cost but high resolution identification of hybrids and their phylogenetic relations.",

The global distribution of a few species (e.g., Pontoscolex corethrurus) was noted by early naturalists, but now approximately 120 such peregrine species are recognized to be widespread from regional to global scales, mainly via human activities. Species adapted to human transport and to colonization of disturbed habitats are most widespread and are the principal invasive species. We identify a number of endogenous and exogenous factors that may contribute to the successful establishment and spread of peregrine species. Quantification of these factors may help to determine why certain species become invasive while others do not. Recent advances in theory and modeling of biological invasions and in molecular techniques should prove fruitful in improving our understanding of invasive earthworms, as well as in predicting their impacts on ecosystems.",

We also investigated the variability of newly obtained cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) sequences of specimens from France, Italy and Switzerland.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Obama nungara\n                was recorded from 72 of the 96 Departments of Metropolitan France. The species is especially abundant along the Atlantic coast, from the Spanish border to Brittany, and along the Mediterranean coast, from the Spanish border to the Italian border. More than half of the records were from an altitude below 50 m, and no record was from above 500 m; mountainous regions such as the Alps, Pyrenees and Massif Central are not invaded. Local abundance can be impressive, with 100 of specimens found in a small garden. An analysis of our new COI sequences, combined with published sequences of specimens from several countries, confirmed that three clades comprise the species. The first clade, ‘Brazil’, is currently confined to this country in South America; the second clade, ‘Argentina 2’, was found in Argentina and in Europe, only in Spain; and the third, ‘Argentina 1’, was found in Argentina and in Europe, in Spain, Portugal, France, UK, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland. This suggests that two clades of\n                O. nungara\n                from Argentina have invaded Europe, with one widely spread.\n              \n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              \n                The present findings strongly suggest that\n                O. nungara\n                is a highly invasive species and that the population which has invaded several countries in Europe comes from Argentina. The wide dispersion of the species and its reported local abundance, combined with the predatory character of the species, make\n                O. nungara\n                a potential threat to the biodiversity and ecology of the native soil fauna in Europe, and probably the most threatening species of all invasive land planarians present in Europe.",

This is the first report on the occurrence of Capreolia implexa outside of Australasian waters, based on investigations of fresh collections in southern Chile as well as Australia and New Zealand. Thalli are prostrate and form entangled turfs, growing on high intertidal rocks at three locations in Chile. Analyses of rbcL and cox1 revealed that C. implexa was of Australasian origin and also distinct from its relatives. Analyses of 1356. bp of cox1 revealed cryptic diversity, consisting of two genealogical groups within C. implexa; one present in Australia and New Zealand, and the other in Chile and Stewart Island, New Zealand. The extremely low genetic diversity found in C. implexa in Chile and the absence of shared haplotypes between Chile and Australasia suggest genetic bottleneck possibly as a result of colonization after dispersal by rafting from Stewart Island, New Zealand to Chile. &copy; 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

These processes have been studied for above-ground organisms, but associated changes below the ground have received little attention. We surveyed rainforest and plantation systems in Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia, to investigate effects of land-use change on the diversity and abundance of earthworms—a major group of soil-ecosystem engineers that often is associated with human activities. Density and biomass of earthworms increased 4—30-fold in oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations compared to rainforest. Despite much higher abundance, earthworm communities in plantations were less diverse and dominated by the peregrine morphospecies Pontoscolex corethrurus, often recorded as invasive. Considering the high deforestation rate in Indonesia, invasive earthworms are expected to dominate soil communities across the region in the near future, in lieu of native soil biodiversity. Ecologically-friendly management approaches, increasing structural habitat complexity and plant diversity, may foster beneficial effects of invasive earthworms on plant growth while mitigating negative effects on below-ground biodiversity and the functioning of the native soil animal community.",

            "abstractNote": "The invasive Asiatic green alga Codium fragile subsp. tomentosoides, which was introduced to the northwestern Atlantic in eastern Long Island Sound, New York during 1957, has recently colonized several parts of the Gulf of Maine via two invasion sites: (1) mid-coastal Maine at Boothbay Harbor after transplantation of Long Island oysters (1964); and (2) southern Massachusetts as a result of the expansion of attached plants from the Cape Cod Canal (1969) into nearby Cape Cod Bay (1972). Because of its warm-water affinities, southern New England populations initially expanded more rapidly than northern ones, becoming particularly invasive in shallow subtidal habitats. By contrast, the Boothbay Harbor populations were rather \"quiescent,\" long-lived, and circumscribed until the early 1970s. After a buildup of significant biomass, extensive fragmentation and drifting occurred via strong south-flowing currents; thereafter, Codium colonized mid-coastal Maine, New Hampshire, and northern Massachusetts. Currently, the Casco Bay area just south of Boothbay Harbor has the highest number of invasion sites, particularly at offshore islands. Attached populations are limited to a few contiguous sites just north of Boothbay Harbor, with only drift specimens occurring in \"Downeast\" Maine. Recent introductions have also been recorded in the Canadian Maritime Provinces, both within the Atlantic (1989) and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (1996) shorelines. Thus, the species' expansion in the northwestern Atlantic has involved multiple introductions, different vectors (shellfish and vessels), dispersal by major south-flowing currents, and differential viability/abundance of in situ populations due to varying hydrographic and exposure conditions. In comparing a series of permanent study sites in southern Maine and New Hampshire during 1982 to 2001, Codium increased from one to 26 sites during 19 years, with the most evident expansion between 1996—1998. A comparison of several demographic features (length, weight, density, biomass, and percent occurrence) for six Codium populations ranging from mid-coastal Maine to New Hampshire showed that outer estuarine and nearshore open coastal plants were smaller and had more limited densities and biomass than those found at warmer offshore insular sites like Star Island, New Hampshire. Codium is now the dominant canopy species in some southern Maine and New Hampshire locations, extending to ∼8 m below mean low water; it occurs in both disturbed sites (e.g., former urchin barrens) and established kelp beds at sheltered and exposed locations. The Asiatic red alga Neosiphonia (= Polysiphonia) harveyi, which is the dominant epiphyte on Codium, is also exhibiting a rapid expansion in this same geography. Drifting populations of Codium may be a good vector for its introduction, as well as for several other epiphytes. Another aspect of the invasion of Codium into the Gulf of Maine is the spread of the introduced bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, which is common on kelps but appears to be exhibiting enhanced survival on Codium because of its perennial growth pattern and lack of epibiontic sloughing.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduced habitat-providing organisms such as epibenthic bivalves may facilitate the invasion and expansion of further non-native species which may modify the effects of the primary invader on the native system. In the sedimentary intertidal Wadden Sea (south-eastern North Sea) introduced Paciﬁc oysters (Crassostrea gigas) have overgrown native blue mussel beds (Mytilus edulis). These oyster beds are now providing the major attachment substratum for macroalgae. Recently, oysters have expanded their distribution into the shallow subtidal zone of the Wadden Sea, and there support a rich associated species community including the Japanese seaweed Sargassum muticum, which has been presumably introduced together with the oysters. With a block designed ﬁeld experiment, we explored the effects of S. muticum on the associated community of soft-bottom C. gigas beds in the shallow subtidal. Replicated oyster plots of 1 m2 were arranged with a density of 0, 7, 15 or 45 S. muticum m− 2, respectively. We found no effects of different S. muticum densities on associated epi- and endobenthic community compositions associated to the oyster plots. However, the overall coverage of sessile organisms settling on the oyster shells was signiﬁcantly reduced at high S. muticum densities. The occurrence of abundant native macro-algal species such as Polysiphonia nigrescens, Antithamnion plumula and Elachista fucicola decreased with increasing S. muticum densities. Sessile invertebrates, by contrast, were only marginally affected and we found no effects of S. muticum canopy on diversity and abundance of endofauna organisms. We conclude that increasing densities of S. muticum on C. gigas beds in the shallow subtidal zone of the Wadden Sea limit the occurrence of native macroalgae which otherwise would beneﬁt from the additional hard substratum provided by the oysters. Thus, a secondary invader may abolish the effects of the primary invader for native species by occupying the new formed niche.",

To verify the geographic distribution of these two species, we analyzed specimens of C. teedei from the Western Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Spain, as well as of C. chamissoi from Chile using plastid rbcL and mitochondrial COI genes. The phylogenetic tree of rbcL revealed that âC. teedeiâ from Asia and Chondracanthus sp. from France are conspecific with C. chamissoi from Chile, but distinct from the clade of C. teedei from the Atlantic. These results indicate that C. chamissoi is not exclusively distributed in the southeastern Pacific, but is also found in Korea/Japan and France, whereas C. teedei is found in the Atlantic and not in the western Pacific region. This study demonstrated that the range of C. chamissoi is wider than previously thought, raising interesting questions regarding the transportation vector and the absence of C. teedei from Korea and Japan. In addition, we confirmed that molecular analyses can be used to examine the geographic distribution of marine macroalgae.",

Integrated fisheries assessment and possible causes for the collapse of anchovy kilka in the Caspian Sea. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 503–511.Anchovy kilka (Clupeonella engrauliformis) is the most abundant species of fish in the Caspian Sea. An integrated catch-at-age analysis based on commercial catch data and relative abundance indices from research surveys over the period 1991–2004 indicated two main periods. First, a period of high catches, from 1991 to 2000, sustained by relatively good recruitment and high spawning-stock biomass. At the end of this period, catches peaked at up to 271 400 t, fishing mortality reached 1.8 y−1 in 1999, and overfishing seems to have taken place. Over the next period, 2001–2004, the stock virtually collapsed, recruitment failing in 2001 and remaining very low thereafter. In 2005, total catches dropped to a historical minimum of 54 300 t. The most likely primary cause of the stock collapse is the invasion and spread of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in the Caspian Sea. The dramatic recruitment failure from 2001 to 2004 is primarily attributed to competition/predation by this ctenophore, although other factors, including overfishing, likely contributed.",

However, it is becoming obvious that native species are not always well-behaved and can develop populations that quickly reach nuisance levels that require management to avoid negative ecological impacts. This work summarizes information presented at the American Society for Horticultural Science Invasive Plants Research Professional Interest Group Workshops in 2017 and 2018, and it highlights the phenomenon of species that are considered both native and invasive in the aquatic ecosystems of Florida. These “natives gone rogue” are compared with the introduced species they mimic, and the consequences of excessive aquatic plant growth, regardless of the origin of the species, are described.",

            "abstractNote": "Alien aquatic plants rank amongst the major threats to aquatic biodiversity and, since ongoing climate change is expected to facilitate their further spread, there is an urgent need for sound knowledge of their distribution and ecology. We collected published and unpublished data spanning the last ~130 years and performed the first comprehensive assessment of alien aquatic vascular plants in Slovakia with the following aims: (i) to prepare a national inventory, (ii) to assess the effects of climate and landscape on species diversity and (iii) to evaluate the habitat preferences of the species. The historical overview showed a strongly increasing trend in the number of alien species related to an increased amount of intensive research of aquatic vegetation over the last 30 years. Altogether, 20 neophyte alien aquatic plant taxa were recorded from 479 sampling sites. However, the species inventory seems to be far from complete and approximately 14 species are expected to remain undetected.\n              Elodeacanadensis\n              and\n              E.nuttallii\n              are the most frequently occurring alien aquatic plants, while eight other species have been found at a single site only. The majority of alien plants were deliberately introduced as aquarium ornamentals or released through pond waste. The fragmented information on local habitat conditions did not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the habitat preferences of alien aquatic plants. However, artificial water bodies are more frequently colonised by alien species than natural habitats (95% of aliens were found in artificial water bodies and 60% of them were recorded exclusively in these habitats) and many species have broad environmental tolerances (ability to colonise both standing and running waters, tolerances to a wide range of temperatures and water chemistry). Our results reaffirm the major role of increased temperatures and landscape modification in the distribution of alien aquatic plants and we can expect enhanced invasiveness and spreading of alien species into new habitats driven by climate change and land use intensification. Filling a main gap in the recognition of alien aquatic plant environmental preferences is a challenge for future research with the ultimate goal of maintaining natural aquatic plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.",

It may not have been the result of deliberate government policy, yet British ‘obtuseness, short-sightedness and ignorance’ – and stubborn commitment to laissez-faire ‘solutions’ – largely caused the disaster and prevented any serious efforts to relieve suffering. The continuing impact on Anglo-Irish relations was incalculable, the immediate human cost almost inconceivable. In this vivid and disturbing book Cecil Woodham-Smith provides the definitive account. ‘A moving and terrible book. It combines great literary power with great learning.
