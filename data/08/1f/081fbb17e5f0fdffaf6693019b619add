However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors facilitating invasion dynamics and their interactions are still largely unknown. This study compiles and inputs available data for the NIS bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis across the invaded biogeographic range in the Mediterranean basin into a species distribution model to predict future spread under a range of marine scenarios. Location Mediterranean Sea. Methods A systematic review produced the largest presence database ever assembled to inform the selection of biological, chemical and physical factors linked to the spread of B. pharaonis through the Suez Canal. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to simulate current and future trophic and salinity scenarios. A species distribution model was run to determine key drivers of invasion, quantify interactive impacts arising from a range of trophic states, salinity conditions and climatic scenarios and forecast future trajectories for the spread of NIS into new regions under multiple-parameter scenarios (based on the main factors identified from the systematic review). Results Impacts on invasion trajectory arising from climate change and interactions with increasing salinity from the new opening of the canal were the primary drivers of expansion across the basin, the effects of which were further enhanced by eutrophication. Predictions of the current distribution were most accurate when multiple stressors were used to drive the model. A habitat suitability index developed at a subcontinental scale from model outputs identified novel favourable conditions for future colonization at specific locations under 2030 and 2050 climatic scenarios. Main conclusions Future expansion of B. pharaonis will be enhanced by climate-facilitated increased sea temperature, interacting with increasing pressures from salinity and eutrophication. The spatially explicit risk output maps of invasions represent a powerful visual product for use in communication of the spread of NIS and decision-support tools for scientists and policymakers. The suggested approach, the observed distribution pattern and driving processes can be applied to other NIS species and regions by providing novel forecasts of species occurrences under future multiple stressor scenarios and the location of suitable recipient habitats with respect to anthropogenic and environmental parameters.",

            "abstractNote": "The responses of tallgrass prairie plant communities and ecosystem processes to fire and grazing are well characterized. However, responses of invertebrate consumer groups, and particularly soil-dwelling organisms, to these disturbances are not well known. At Konza Prairie Biological Station, we sampled soil macroinvertebrates in 1994 and 1999 as part of a long-term experiment designed to examine the effects and interactions of annual fire, mowing, and fertilization (N and P) on prairie soil communities and processes. For nearly all taxa, in both years, responses were characterized by significant treatment interactions, but some general patterns were evident. Introduced European earthworms (Aporrectodea spp. and Octolasion spp.) were most abundant in plots where fire was excluded, and the proportion of the total earthworm community consisting of introduced earthworms was greater in unburned, unmowed, and fertilized plots. Nymphs of two Cicada genera were collected (Cicadetta spp. and Tibicen spp.). Cicadetta nymphs were more abundant in burned plots, but mowing reduced their abundance. Tibicen nymphs were collected almost exclusively from unburned plots. Treatment effects on herbivorous beetle larvae (Scarabaeidae, Elateridae, and Curculionidae) were variable, but nutrient additions (N or P) usually resulted in greater densities, whereas mowing usually resulted in lower densities. Our results suggest that departures from historical disturbance regimes (i.e. frequent fire and grazing) may render soils more susceptible to increased numbers of European earthworms, and that interactions between fire, aboveground biomass removal, and vegetation responses affect the structure and composition of invertebrate communities in tallgrass prairie soils.",

Recent studies indicate that disturbance-induced changes in soil nutrient availability could influence community invasibility, but the importance of this mechanism in the real world is not known. We tested the hypotheses that (i) exotic plant species profit from drought effects on soil functioning more than do natives; and (ii) grassland invasibility depends on soil responses to drought disturbance, which are greater in soils that exhibit a larger nutrient pulse following drought. This was tested in a series of grassland sites of contrasting management intensity which we subjected to an extreme (40-day) drought, after which seeds from four different plant families of native species and related exotics were added to soils originating from the drought and control treatments under greenhouse conditions. We also examined the performance of seeded native species in the field. We expected that intensively managed grasslands with bacterial-dominated soils would exhibit a larger nutrient pulse following drought, and hence a greater window of opportunity for invasion, than in extensively managed grassland soils with fungal-dominated microbial communities. Results from the greenhouse experiment indicated that exotic species grew better in soil that had experienced drought, and had higher survival and growth rates than natives in both grassland types. Field results showed that drought increased invasibility in intensively managed grasslands, but had little impact on survival and growth of seeded species on extensively managed grassland soils. Increased invasibility of intensively managed grassland soils was associated with a significant soil nitrogen pulse following rewetting, which was not detected in the extensively managed grasslands. Synthesis. Our results indicate that intensively managed grasslands are more prone to invasion following drought than are extensively managed grasslands and that this response is in part related to differences in microbial community composition which regulate nutrient availability in soil following disturbance events. Given that extreme climate events are predicted to increase, our findings suggest that invasion of exotic species will increase in ecosystems with soils that are less resilient to disturbance.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural flow regimes are important for sustaining riverine vegetation. The regulation of river flows to provide water for agriculture often results in changes to flow timing. This study assesses the impact of altered seasonal flow patterns on riverine flora. Within temperate Australia, we surveyed the vegetation of five lowland rivers, three of which have large dams that alter their seasonal flow patterns; the other two are unregulated. From four to six sites were selected on each river, and these were classified into three levels of regulation based on the extent to which the timing of their seasonal flow patterns were altered. Sites were surveyed in winter and the following summer. Permanent quadrats were also established at a number of the surveyed sites and resurveyed every 3 months. Of the 267 plant taxa identified, 145 were exotic (non-native). More exotic taxa and fewer native taxa were associated with increasing level of seasonal flow inversion (regulation). In particular, greater numbers of short-lived exotic terrestrial taxa and fewer native woody taxa were associated with increasing level of regulation. Some exotic woody species (e.g. willows) were more common in the unregulated rivers and may have life-history traits favoured by the natural seasonal flow patterns of study area. Multivariate analyses showed that level of regulation had a significant effect on the overall composition of the riverine vegetation. Our results provide support for the hypotheses that flow regulation adversely affects native species diversity and increases the vulnerability of riparian zones to invasion by exotic species; however, these effects are dependent on plant species' life-history strategies. Our study highlights the importance of natural seasonal flow patterns for sustaining native riverine plant communities. Flow management aimed at maintaining or restoring ecological values should consider seasonal flow patterns. Winter/spring flow peaks may be particularly important for the recruitment of native riverine plants, especially trees and shrubs, and reducing the extent of exotic annuals and grasses.

The amount of habitat that individuals in a metapopulation have access to can be divided into four components, the amount of habitat in the present habitat parch (A(i)), the amount of connected habitat in other patches available via migration (Gamma(i)), the amount of presented habitat in the present patch after time period Delta t(A(i)'). and the amount of linked habitat in other patches after time period Delta t(Gamma(i)'). Deterministic threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence in patch networks can be approximated with these quantities. For instance, in a version of the Levins model with er;tinction risk proportional to the inverse of patch area and colonization probability proportional to patch connectivity, the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence is given by <(Gamma A)over bar> +Var(Gamma A)/<(Gamma A)over bar> > e/c, where e and c are the species-specific extinction and colonization parameters. I conjecture that with measures A' and Gamma' the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence can be extended to dynamic landscapes, in which all or part of population turnover is caused by turnover in the habitat patches themselves. The measures of habitat availability described in this paper can be used to rank dissimilar fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support a viable metapopulation.",

We tested the effects of physical disturbance, water and nutrient addition on growth and survival of a total of 28 plant species from urban bushland remnants on low fertility Hawkesbury Sandstone soils in Sydney, Australia. Species were classified as native (to Australia, including the local community) or exotic (from outside Australia) and as non-invasive or invasive. 2 In a glasshouse experiment the treatments were control (natural soil), added water, added nutrients and added water and nutrients. We found significant differences in response of the plant types to additional nutrients but not to water. Under additional nutrients, exotic invasive species had better survival than all other plant types. There were strong biomass responses to added nutrients for all plant types except native non-invasives. In contrast, the survival and growth of all plant types were similar under control and additional water treatments. 3 In a field experiment the factors were site (high and low nutrient soils) and physical disturbance but survival differed between plant types only in relation to site. Exotic species had much better survival than native species at the high nutrient site only. Exotic invasive species had the strongest biomass responses to the high nutrient site while native and exotic non-invasive species showed relatively smaller growth responses. 4 Differences between invasive and non-invasive plants were not consistent between exotic and native species. Exotic invasives had greater survival than exotic non-invasives under high nutrient conditions in both experiments, and only exotic invasives showed consistently strong biomass responses to nutrient addition. For native species, there were no differences between invasives and non-invasives in survival in high nutrient conditions in the glasshouse or field; however, only invasive species showed a positive growth response to high nutrient conditions. 5 This study provides clear evidence that the success of exotic invasive species in this low fertility vegetation community is facilitated by the addition of nutrients. It would appear that on relatively infertile (particularly phosphorus-limited) sites, invasive species cannot take advantage of additional resources provided by physical disturbance or water addition due to overwhelming nutrient-limitation. We suggest that a combination of the environmental conditions (nutrient-enrichment) and invading species having traits that allow high survival and faster growth in response to nutrients, may allow successful invasion in Hawkesbury Sandstone communities.",

Roadside plant assemblages are driven by the interplay between propagule arrival and seedling establishment, which are highly influenced by roadside characteristics, landscape configuration and road management and maintenance practices. Multiple plant species with different growth forms use roadsides as temporary or permanent habitats and/or dispersal corridors. Over the past seven decades, numerous studies have documented how roadsides affect the distribution and dispersal of plant species; however, a comprehensive review of those is lacking in the literature. Here, we addressed this issue and found 1,098 studies that met all the study eligibility criteria. Over half of the studies reported the effects of roadsides on the distribution and dispersal of exotic/weed species only, of which all but one indicated a positive effect, and around three quarters of the studies that considered native species showed a positive effect of roadsides on such species. Only 10 studies corroborated the use of roadsides as linear corridors by some native species to expand their distributional ranges. Generally, roadsides had the most positive effects for native species in landscapes that are greatly impacted by intensive agriculture, urbanization and forest management, while negative effects were concentrated in areas that have not been highly altered by humans. Furthermore, studies regarding exotic/weed species were concentrated within a few regions of the world. We conclude that roadsides are key to maintain native biodiversity, especially in highly modified anthropogenic landscapes, but also serve as landscape corridors for exotic species.",

They are often planted with non-native species and frequently provide vectors for the introduction and spread of invasive species. Public transportation managers need to balance the rapid revegetation of roadsides with the goal of maximizing use of native species and minimizing the introduction of non-native species. 2 This study examined vegetation–site relationships along 13 major four-lane highways in West Virginia, USA, using analysis of variance, multiresponse permutation procedures and indicator species analysis. 3 Mean soil nutrient values showed some differences with respect to highway, but fewer when highway positions were compared. Similarly, when highway position was considered, there were no significant differences in mean plant species richness, evenness or diversity. 4 Results of multiresponse permutation procedures suggested that different highways may be characterized by distinct vegetation assemblages. This hypothesis was supported by indicator species analysis: 54 species showed a statistically significant (P < 0·05) affinity to one highway over all others. More than half of these were classified as non-native and exotic invasive species. When highway position was considered, no significant differences in community composition were found, and indicator species analysis found only 25 species that exhibited a significant affinity to one type of position. Of these, only eight were exotic. 5 Of the 33 most abundant herbaceous species, 11 showed a significant relationship between cover and distance from pavement. For all but one, average cover declined in a linear fashion with increasing distance. 6 Synthesis and applications. Despite extensive topographic disturbance associated with highway construction, the resultant vegetative communities do not differ with respect to type of construction or resultant landform. This suggests that highway agencies can manage roadside vegetation using similar, standard techniques. Roadsides are optimal growing sites for exotic invasive species that out-compete native vegetation. Management goals should therefore include techniques for limiting the establishment of these species, and substitution of non-native species planted for erosion control with suitable native species.",

We measured plant diversity and cover for 27 randomly selected paired powerline and woodland plots along a 140-km rights-of-way corridor that extended from northern Connecticut into southern New Hampshire. Mean plant richness was significantly higher in powerline plots (x¯=49.8 species) than in woodland plots (x¯=29.5 species). Powerline plots with the greatest richness were those that included a maintenance road or other areas of disturbed, open soil. Three hundred and twenty-six plant species were recorded in powerline plots, more than twice the number found in woodland plots (n=157). Powerline plots had higher invasive plant cover than the woodland plots, but non-native invasive species cover was low (<2%) in both powerline and woodland plots. Cover of clonal species was greater in the powerline plots (mean values of 12.0% ±1.2 vs. 4.0% ±0.6). Northern powerline plots in our study, maintained exclusively by mowing, had a higher proportion of tree cover than southern plots that were maintained by mowing plus spot-application of herbicides. No differences were found in the proportional cover of all woody plants, clonal species, or invasive species among the two management types. We include a discussion of host-specialized Lepidoptera, oligolectic bees, and other wildlife that are dependent on vegetation composition and structure found along transmission line corridors in the Northeast.",

Road age is a key factor that could influence the susceptibility of roads to invasion as older roads are typically subject to higher cumulative levels of human disturbance and propagule pressure than younger roads. We investigated the effects of road age on the spread of non-native earthworms, which act as ecosystem engineers. 2 We sampled earthworms and habitat variables at 98 roads in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, to determine the influence of road age on non-native earthworm occurrence at the landscape level. The extent and rate of local spread were also assessed at seven sites adjacent to old and young roads. Generalized estimating equations and zero-inflated negative binomial regression were used to analyze landscape- and local-level results, respectively. We used our models to create maps that predict the current and potential future extent of earthworms in north-eastern Alberta. 3 Probability of earthworm occurrence and extent of spread increased as road age increased. Areas closer to agriculture and towards the south and west of our study area were also significantly more likely to be invaded by earthworms. 4 Our spread model indicated that approximately 9% of the boreal forest of north-eastern Alberta is likely invaded by earthworms currently. This is projected to increase to 49% of suitable forest habitat over the next 50 years as human development intensifies in this region. 5 Synthesis and applications. Although the effects of roads and linear features are commonly investigated in relation to native species, our results emphasize the importance of considering the impacts of linear feature creation on the spread of invasive species. We demonstrate that road age in particular can be an important factor affecting the spread of invasive species. In the boreal forest, reducing the number of roads being constructed, restricting traffic, and reclaiming temporary roads will be critical to reduce the future extent of earthworm invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "ContextSeed-dispersing animals often move along “linear gaps” (linear anthropogenic features such as roads and trails that contain little vegetation), especially in densely-vegetated landscapes. As a result, linear gaps and their verges may receive more seeds than adjacent habitats. In addition, linear gap verges may provide more suitable conditions for plant establishment than neighboring habitats. In this way, linear gaps may increase plant abundance and diversity, and facilitate connectivity of native and non-native plant populations, ultimately increasing plant diversity in the landscape.ObjectivesWe reviewed current evidence for the potential of anthropogenic linear gaps to increase plant abundance and diversity, and for the mechanisms involved.MethodsWe reviewed peer-reviewed literature published up to December 31st, 2014.ResultsMost (69.2 %) studies found significantly higher plant abundance and/or diversity in linear gap verges than in adjacent habitats. This suggests that linear gaps can increase plant abundance and diversity, and possibly facilitate population spread. However, there was a strong bias toward the study of exotic species. In addition, there were few mechanistic studies to allow estimation of the relative contributions of dispersal and post-dispersal mechanisms operating in linear gaps.ConclusionsFuture studies should focus on entire plant communities, not just exotic species, and should allow identification of the mechanisms by which linear gaps increase plant abundance and diversity. With this knowledge in hand, we will be in a better position to understand whether the net benefit of linear gaps for plant diversity in general outweigh their facilitation of the spread of exotic species.",

Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R 2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0–4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world’s last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.",

Such efforts are often limited to local scales and/or to single species, due to the challenges of data acquisition at larger scales. Here, we map the distribution of non-native freshwater species richness across the continental United States and investigate the role of human activity in driving macroscale patterns of aquatic invasion. Location: The continental United States. Methods: We assembled maps of non-native aquatic species richness by compiling occurrence data on exotic animal and plant species from publicly accessible databases. Using a dasymetric model of human population density and a spatially explicit model of recreational freshwater fishing demand, we analysed the effect of these metrics of human influence on the degree of invasion at the watershed scale, while controlling for spatial and sampling bias. We also assessed the effects that a temporal mismatch between occurrence data (collected since 1815) and cross-sectional predictors (developed using 2010 data) may have on model fit. Results: Non-native aquatic species richness exhibits a highly patchy distribution, with hotspots in the Northeast, Great Lakes, Florida, and human population centres on the Pacific coast. These richness patterns are correlated with population density, but are much more strongly predicted by patterns of recreational fishing demand. These relationships are strengthened by temporal matching of datasets and are robust to corrections for sampling effort. Main conclusions: Distributions of aquatic non-native species across the continental US are better predicted by freshwater recreational fishing than by human population density. This suggests that observed patterns are driven by a mechanistic link between recreational activity and aquatic non-native species richness and are not merely the outcome of sampling bias associated with human population density.",

            "abstractNote": "Predicting which species are probable invaders has been a long-standing goal of ecologists, but only recently have quantitative methods been used to achieve such a goal. Although restricted to few taxa, these studies reveal clear relationships between the characteristics of releases and the species involved, and the successful establishment and spread of invaders. For example, the probability of bird establishment increases with the number of individuals released and the number of release events. Also, the probability of plant invasiveness increases if the species has a history of invasion and reproduces vegetatively. These promising quantitative approaches should be more widely applied to allow us to predict patterns of invading species more successfully.",

Prescribed ﬁre beneﬁted native composition over short time scales (<1 yr) but, on average, had no effect on native performance, nor on exotic composition or performance. In contrast, wildﬁre consistently enhanced exotic composition and performance over all time scales, while having no effect on native species composition and signiﬁcantly reducing native performance. Additionally, responses varied by habitat: native species groups responded positively to prescribed ﬁre in heathlands and to a lesser extent in temperate grasslands, while responding negatively to wildﬁre in arid shrublands and heathlands, and to a more modest degree in tropical savannas. Exotic species groups responded positively to wildﬁre in arid shrublands, temperate forests and heathlands.\nConclusions: This quantitative assessment of the literature revealed strong evidence for a positive response of exotics to wildﬁre, coupled with a striking near-absence of negative responses. The assessment additionally suggests that while prescribed ﬁre does beneﬁt native composition, on average, it does not appear to greatly facilitate native performance; however site-speciﬁc variation in how communities responded to ﬁre was pronounced, underscoring the importance of local assessments in determining mechanistic drivers and management policy.",

            "abstractNote": "We examine the distribution of American mink Mustela vison in 28 European countries, and we review the impacts of this invasive species and the efforts made so far in controlling it. Our study reveals that, although mink farms are mostly concentrated in northern countries, mink are widely distributed across Europe, and that in some countries mink are apparently declining, although in most cases the causes are unknown. Countries for which the impact of mink on native species has been studied show that mink can have a signiﬁcant effect on ground-nesting birds, rodents, amphibians and mustelids. The overall economic impact of feral mink seems to be relatively small but can be signiﬁcant in speciﬁc regions. Recently, a number of eradication and local control projects have been carried out throughout Europe, indicating that these actions could be effective to protect native species. A consistent body of knowledge is starting to accumulate on issues concerning the American mink as an invasive alien species, but, as this review highlights, for most European countries there is currently a limited knowledge about its distribution or impacts. Taking all these observations together, we present some of the actions that have recently emerged as effective for dealing with this species and discuss which considerations may further encourage competent European authorities to take action to prevent and mitigate impacts of American mink.",

These comparative studies provide insights into the more general question “Do alien invasive plants usually outperform co-occurring native species, and to what degree does the answer depend on growing conditions?” Based on 79 independent native-invasive plant comparisons, the alien invaders were not statistically more likely to have higher growth rates, competitive ability, or fecundity. Rather, the relative performance of invaders and co-occurring natives often depended on growing conditions. In 94% of 55 comparisons involving more than one growing condition, the native's performance was equal or superior to that of the invader, at least for some key performance measures in some growing conditions. Most commonly, these conditions involved reduced resources (nutrients, light, water) and/or specific disturbance regimes. Independently of growing conditions, invaders were more likely to have higher leaf area and lower tissue construction costs (advantageous under high light and nutrient conditions) and greater phenotypic plasticity (particularly advantageous in disturbed environments where conditions are in frequent flux). There appear to be few “super invaders” that have universal performance advantages over co-occurring natives; rather, increased resource availability and altered disturbance regimes associated with human activities often differentially increase the performance of invaders over that of natives.",

We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread.",

            "abstractNote": "Linear infrastructure intrusions are common around the world to meet the needs of a growing and interconnected human population. The implementation of linear infrastructures involves numerous forms and mechanisms of land-use transformation that can facilitate and serve as pathways to the spread of invasive non-native species. However, the type and intensity of land transformations change over time and this can affect the frequency and intensity in which linear infrastructures route the spread of invasive species. Here, we present results collected over 5 years of monitoring surveys (2015–2019) to assess the relationship between the construction of one of the largest canals to date in Brazil and the spread of non-native species. We studied the Integration Project of the São Francisco River (PISF), a canal fully inserted in the Caatinga biome, a tropical dry forest ecosystem for which information on invasion dynamics are little known. Our results confirmed PISF canals served as habitat and dispersal corridors for non-native plant species. Monitoring surveys recorded 26 non-native species established along the 83.2 km2 PISF deployment area. Eleven years after the canal deployment area was completely cleared of vegetation, 92.3% of its extension had non-native plant populations. Of the 10 species assessed for their population status, 8 had invasive populations. The time immediately after construction work finished was the critical stage for the spread of non-native woody plants, which increased their distributions with reduced levels of construction intervention, whereas most of the herbaceous species reduced their distributions. When human intervention was drastically reduced, many populations of non-native plants rapidly formed at the deployment area. Policy implications. Man-made linear infrastructures can remove biogeographical barriers and serve as pathways for the spread of invasive species over long distances and across ecosystems. Thus, the planning, construction and management of such infrastructures should include measures and funding for risk assessment, prevention, monitoring and control of biological invasions. Agencies responsible for environmental licensing should mandate invasive species management as part of the installation and operation licensing conditions.",

There exists a high probability for the introduction of six non-indigenous invertebrate species, i.e., Anguillicola crassus, Potamothrix heuscheri, Potamothrix vejdovskyi, Hemimysis anomala, Cercopagis pengoi and Gmelinoides fasciatus, with the Gulf of Finland as the main donor area. Barriers against new species introductions, which maintain the biological integrity of Finnish inland lakes, include low water temperature, northern isolated location, and low concentration of nutrients and major ions.",

Research and monitoring of its impacts are generally lacking, and the usefulness of hatchery release for fisheries and conservation objectives is unclear. Here, I evaluated positive and negative impacts of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching programmes in a systematic review associated with meta-analyses with the goal of reducing bias of the review. Vast numbers of individuals of more than 180 species are released into the wild each year, but most studies are at experimental stages to assess its potential, and empirical studies are sparse for evaluating the impact on fishery production. Most cases are economically unprofitable except for a few successful cases or unevaluated. The effects of releasing juveniles can be dwarfed by the magnitude of natural recruitment when the spawning stock produces much larger recruitment than released juveniles. Density-dependent growth caused by competition of food can be substantial, and growth rates of hatchery and wild fish and other competitive species can simultaneously be reduced when stocking exceeded the carrying capacity. Relative reproductive success can vary depending on the species, seed quality and environmental factors. Empirical studies show evidence of substantial gene flow from hatcheries, but fitness reduction in stocked populations has not been reported. The results represent the current state of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching activity and provide key information for growing fields of artificial propagation and conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural and human-generated disturbances are widely acknowledged as key drivers of biological invasions. Understanding the role of spatial patterns of compounded disturbances in determining invader establishment and spread can enhance the effectiveness of control strategies. Using the framework of 1/f noise models and by means of a field experiment, we evaluated how the simultaneous exposure of Posidonia oceanica meadows to disturbances (namely overgrazing and rhizome uprooting from vessel anchoring) differing in spatial extent and degree of autocorrelation influenced the establishment and spread of the invasive seaweed, Caulerpa racemosa. Effects on invader establishment and spread were evaluated by means of mixed-effect models relating spatial patterns of disturbance and presence or abundance of C. racemosa, quantified through spectral coefficients. The spatial distribution of C. racemosa mimicked that of overgrazing, both variables showing positive autocorrelation. Yet, C. racemosa was unable to disperse from disturbed patches into adjacent intact areas. The uprooting of rhizomes did not promote the establishment of C. racemosa, but magnified (≃18 times) the proliferation of the exotic seaweed when coupled with overgrazing. Synthesis and applications. Fish overgrazing of Posidonia oceanica lessens the resistance of seagrass beds to invasion by Caulerpa racemosa. Thus, conservation strategies (e.g. marine protected areas) aiming to restore over-exploited fish populations may indirectly enhance the susceptibility of P. oceanica meadows to invasion by C. racemosa. Uprooting of P. oceanica rhizomes, such as that caused by boat anchoring, exacerbates the effects of overgrazing. The anchoring of recreational vessels should be, therefore, strictly regulated in areas characterized by intense grazing of P. oceanica leaves. More generally, our study shows that native herbivores may indirectly facilitate invasion by reducing the resistance of resident plant communities and suggests that sounded strategies for controlling the establishment and spread of invasive species require taking into account the interactive effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances.",

Exotic species act at various levels of organisation of macroinvertebrate communities, and are involved in different processes mediating their impacts on biodiversity, such as habitat modification or negative interactions with autochthonous fauna. The present work gives a list of the 43 French freshwater non-indigenous species, which represent 1.2% of the French freshwater macroinvertebrates. We provide their geographic origins, their distributions among zoological units by comparison with the native fauna and their functional characteristics according to a recent typology based on bio/ecological traits. An exponential trend of the cumulated number of non-indigenous species was evidenced, with a clumping of invaders within crustaceans and molluscs. Donor areas of non-indigenous species are in majority European, and the Ponto-Caspian basin is identified as the principal one. This pattern could be explained by a spread along waterways but its origin lies in a process of recolonisation of defaunated areas following several episodes of glaciation/deglaciation in Western Europe during the last 80,000 years. Finally, from a functional point of view, non-indigenous species exhibit a limited diversity, with two functional groups representing 80% of them.",

            "abstractNote": "The assessment of risks associated with non-indigenous species implies a detailed knowledge of their taxonomical composition and distribution within a certain region. The northern branch of the central European ‘invasion corridor’—a series of canals connecting different watersheds—has formed an important migratory route for Ponto-Caspian fish (i.e. fish from the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea). However, the current status of non-indigenous fish species in this region is very scarce. This article presents a comprehensive overview of recent distribution data of non-indigenous fish species in the northern branch of the central European invasion corridor. Here, extensive data are integrated based on studies performed during 2003–2014 comprising reliable published and unpublished records from the last 12 years. Altogether, ten non-indigenous fish species were currently found in the northern branch of the central European invasion corridor, constituting 19 % of its freshwater fish diversity. Three species, including the Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio), the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and the Chinese sleeper (Perccottus glenii), are considered invasive species. Eight species may potentially invade this region in the near future. A comparison of the history of non-indigenous fish species introduction in the inland waters of the northern branch and other countries of the central European invasion corridor revealed similar introduction trends. Potential expansion of non-indigenous fish species across the central European invasion corridor has international implications that require awareness, cooperation, and government support from each individual country. Disclosure of recently operating vectors for non-indigenous fish introductions within the central European invasion corridor will help predict and prevent their further spread and establishment in this region.",

Angling has been identified as one of these pathways. An online survey of 680 British anglers was conducted to establish patterns of movement by British anglers abroad, and to establish their awareness and use of biosecurity practices. The survey revealed that 44% of British anglers travelled abroad for fishing, visiting 72 different countries. France was the most frequently visited country, accounting for one-third of all trips abroad. The estimated time taken to travel from Western Europe into Great Britain (GB) is within the time frame that INNS have been shown to survive on damp angling equipment. Without biosecurity, it is therefore highly likely that INNS could be unintentionally transported into GB on damp angling gear. Since the launch of the Check, Clean Dry biosecurity campaign in GB in 2011, the number of anglers cleaning their equipment after every trip has increased by 15%, and 80% of anglers now undertake some form of biosecurity. However, a significant proportion of the angling population is still not implementing sufficient, or the correct biosecurity measures to minimize the risk of INNS dispersal on damp angling equipment. With the increase in movement of anglers abroad for fishing, further work is required to establish the potential for INNS introduction through this pathway.",

In addition, we document the legislation and programs that the Chilean government has implemented to limit the entry of exotics to the country or minimize their impact on native wild flora and fauna and on natural ecosystems. We document what is known about the introduction of 26 exotic fish species to continental waters of the country, discussing the distribution and putative effects of those 11 species that may be considered invasive. From a previous list of 24 terrestrial vertebrate invaders, we withdraw the Argentine tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and mouflon (Ovis ammon) because there are no data on their subsistence in the wild. On the other hand, we add three new species: red-eared freshwater turtle (Trachemys scripta), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta rnonachus), and red-crested cardinal (Paroaria coronata), thus keeping the total number of terrestrial invaders unchanged at 24 species. The chief agency in charge of existing laws and regulations regarding the import of exotic freshwater species is the National Fisheries Service (SERNAPESCA, in Spanish), a dependency of the Ministry of Economy. The main agency in charge of enforcing existing laws and regulations regarding the import of exotic terrestrial species to Chile is the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG, in Spanish), a dependency of the Ministry of Agriculture. Currently, SAG is not only controlling major border passes, seaports and airports, but also is funding studies to monitor and control already existing invaders. In addition, the Chilean Forest Service (CONAF, in Spanish) is also concerned about invasive species, but only if they enter national parks and reserves within the National System of Protected Wildlife Areas (SNASPE, in Spanish).",

Location Canterbury, New Zealand. Methods A regional, multiscale survey was conducted across 19 braided river floodplains in multiple catchments. We measured alien and native cover and richness across gradients of flow regime (flow magnitude, variability and high/low-flow events), propagule pressure (inferred from land cover), climate and local-scale floodplain substrate and topography. Boosted regression trees were used to determine the relative and absolute importance of these variables on plant cover and richness. Results The floodplain ecosystems were highly invaded with 154 alien species and only 31 natives. Alien cover was higher in rivers with larger maximum flows, in plots with fine substrate texture, and at higher local river bed elevations. Alien richness increased as the variability of winter flows increased and followed a hump-shaped relationship with river bed elevation. In contrast, native species richness and cover were both shaped primarily by climate and by land cover, higher in cooler and wetter areas with more adjacent native vegetation. Main conclusions Alien and native richness and cover were shaped by different variables, so managing the ecosystem (e.g. flow regime) to mitigate aliens would not necessarily promote natives. Promotion of natives will require considerations of propagule supply and whether extant native species are suited to low-elevation climatic conditions. Aliens were associated with predictors that approximate disturbance processes. Increased flow variability in winter could lead to an increase in the number of aliens; conversely, flow stabilization is likely to allow problematic invaders to increase in cover locally.",

Although establishment success varies substantially among species, the importance of species traits and extrinsic factors as determinants of establishment in existing communities has remained difficult to prove in observational studies because they can be confounded and mask each other. Therefore, we conducted a large multispecies field experiment to disentangle the relative importance of extrinsic factors vs. species characteristics for the establishment success of plants in grasslands. We introduced 48 alien and 45 native plant species at different seed numbers into multiple grassland sites with or without experimental soil disturbance and related their establishment success to species traits assessed in five independent multispecies greenhouse experiments. High propagule pressure and high seed mass were the most important factors increasing establishment success in the very beginning of the experiment. However, after 3 y, propagule pressure became less important, and species traits related to biotic interactions (including herbivore resistance and responses to shading and competition) became the most important drivers of success or failure. The relative importance of different traits was environment-dependent and changed over time. Our approach of combining a multispecies introduction experiment in the field with trait data from independent multispecies experiments in the greenhouse allowed us to detect the relative importance of species traits for early establishment and provided evidence that species traits—fine-tuned by environmental factors—determine success or failure of alien and native plants in temperate grasslands.",

Norsk institutt for naturforskning. \nEtter invasjonen av pukkellaks i norske elver i 2017 og 2019 var det knyttet stor spenning til hvordan invasjonen i 2021 ville se ut. Registreringene i 2021 viser at det totale antallet pukkellaks langs norskekysten og i norske elver var åtte ganger høyere enn i 2019, og hele 17 ganger høyere enn i 2017. Som i de foregående årene var fangsten av pukkellaks aller størst i Finnmark og Troms. \nFangststatistikken fra sjøen og elvene fra 2021 viser i likhet med tidligere år at 1) det fremdeles fanges størst antall pukkellaks i Øst-Finnmark, 2) det var en fortsatt økning i antall pukkellaks i Vest-Finnmark og Nord-Troms, og 3) det var få pukkellaks i elvene fra Nordland og sørover selv om antallet var høyere enn i noe år før 2017. \nTotalt ble 208 000 pukkellaks registrert fanget og observert i norske elver og kystfarvann i 2021. Til sammenligning ble 12 000 pukkellaks registrert i 2017 og 25 000 pukkellaks i 2019. Av fisken fanget i 2021 ble 13 700 fanget ved sportsfiske i elv, 104 000 ved uttaksfiske i elv, 1700 ved sportsfiske i sjøen og 39 000 i kilenot- og krokgarnfiske i sjøen. I tillegg ble 49 000 pukkellaks observert under drivtelling eller kameraovervåking i elver. \nRapportert fangst av pukkellaks i sjølaksefiske (kilenot- og krokgarnfiske) var syv ganger høyere i 2021 enn i 2019. Denne økningen skyldes hovedsakelig økning i fangstene i kilenot- og krokgarnfisket i Finnmark og Troms. Den aller største økningen i antall pukkellaks var i Vest-Finnmark, mellom Nordkapp og Troms, hvor fangsten var hele 23 ganger høyere i 2021 enn i 2019. \nI sportsfisket i elv i 2021 ble det fanget over dobbelt så mange pukkellaks som i 2019, mens antallet pukkellaks fanget i uttaksfisket i elv var hele 11 ganger høyere enn i 2019. I likhet med i både 2017 og 2019 var det elvene i Øst-Finnmark, fra Grense Jakobselv til Nordkapp, som i 2021 mottok flest pukkellaks. I dette området var det samlet sett en ni ganger økning av fangstene fra 2019. Den største økningen i totalt antall fanget pukkellaks fra 2019 til 2021 finner vi imidlertid i elvene i Vest-Finnmark (fra Nordkapp til Troms), med en økning på nesten 11 ganger. Også i Nord-Troms var det en stor økning i antall pukkellaks, med en åtte ganger større totalfangst i 2021 enn i 2019. \nØkningen i antall pukkellaks i 2021 i forhold til tidligere år skyldes at utbredelsen av elver med mye pukkellaks økte vest- og sørover i Troms og Finnmark, men også at det var svært store fangster i noen elver i Øst-Finnmark. I fem elver i Øst-Finnmark (Vestre Jakobselv, Vesterelva i Nesseby, Munkelva, Neiden og Tana) ble det til sammen registrert 109 000 pukkellaks, noe som utgjør 66 % av det totale antallet pukkellaks i elv og 53 % av den totale fangsten i både elv og sjø i Norge i 2021. I Vesterelva alene ble fanget over 20 000 pukkellaks. I Tanaelva ble registrert totalt 49 500 pukkellaks. Fangsten i elvene fra Nordland og sørover var høyere i 2021 enn i 2017 og 2019, men utgjorde fremdeles en liten andel (1,7 %) av den totale elvefangsten i Norge. \nDen første pukkellaksen i en norsk elv ble i 2021 fanget 1. juni, og den siste 14. september. Median fangstperiode for hele landet var uke 30 (26. juli-1. august), det vil si at halvparten av fangstene ble registrert før denne datoen og halvparten etter. Dette er lik median fangstuke som i 2019 (uke 30), men tidligere enn i 2017 (uke 32, 7.-13. august). Datoen for median oppvandring i ulike deler av landet i 2021 varierte lite, men pukkellaksen så ut til å ankomme elvene rundt Varangerfjorden noe tidligere enn i resten av Troms og Finnmark.",

            "abstractNote": "Although the number of studies on invasive plants and animals has risen exponentially, little is known about invasive microbes, especially non-pathogenic ones. Microbial invasions by viruses, bacteria, fungi and protists occur worldwide but are much harder to detect than invasions by macroorganisms. Invasive microbes have the potential to signiﬁcantly alter community structure and ecosystem functioning in diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, increased attention is needed on non-pathogenic invasive microbes, both free-living and symbiotic, and their impacts on communities and ecosystems. Major unknowns include the characteristics that make microbes invasive and properties of the resident communities and the environment that facilitate invasions. A comparison of microbial invasions with invasions of macroorganisms should provide valuable insights into general principles that apply to invasions across all domains of life and to taxon-speciﬁc invasion patterns. Invasive microbes appear to possess traits thought to be common in many invasive macroorganisms: high growth rate and resource utilization efﬁciency, and superior competitive abilities. Invading microorganisms are often similar to native species, but with enhanced performance traits, and tend to spread in lower diversity communities. Global change can exacerbate microbial invasions; therefore, they will likely increase in the future.",

            "abstractNote": "Wild boar are now present on all continents except Antarctica and can greatly affect community structure and ecosystem function. Their destructive feeding habits, primarily rooting disturbance, can reduce plant cover, diversity, and regeneration. Furthermore, predation and habitat destruction by boar can greatly affect animal communities. Effects of wild boar on fungi and aquatic communities are scarcely studied, and soil properties and processes seem more resistant to disturbance. Wild boar also affect humans’ economy as they cause crop damage and transmit diseases to livestock and wildlife. In this review, we found that most of the published literature examines boar effects in their introduced range and little is available from the native distribution. Because most of the research describes direct effects of wild boar on plant communities and predation on some animal communities, less is known about indirect effects on ecosystem function. Finally, predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after wild boar removal are scarce. We identified research gaps and urge the need to lower wild boar densities. Identifying commonalities among wild boar impacts on native ecosystems across its introduced range will help in the design of management strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "Deer are among the world’s most successful invasive mammals and can have substantial deleterious impacts on natural and agricultural ecosystems. Six species have established wild populations in Australia, and the distributions and abundances of some species are increasing. Approaches to managing wild deer in Australia are diverse and complex, with some populations managed as ‘game’ and others as ‘pests’. Implementation of cost-effective management strategies that account for this complexity is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the nature, extent and severity of deer impacts. To clarify the knowledge base and identify research needs, we conducted a systematic review of the impacts and management of wild deer in Australia. Most wild deer are in south-eastern Australia, but bioclimatic analysis suggested that four species are well suited to the tropical and subtropical climates of northern Australia. Deer could potentially occupy most of the continent, including parts of the arid interior. The most significant impacts are likely to occur through direct effects of herbivory, with potentially cascading indirect effects on fauna and ecosystem processes. However, evidence of impacts in Australia is largely observational, and few studies have experimentally partitioned the impacts of deer from those of sympatric native and other introduced herbivores. Furthermore, there has been little rigorous testing of the efficacy of deer management in Australia, and our understanding of the deer ecology required to guide deer management is limited. We identified the following six priority research areas: (i) identifying long-term changes in plant communities caused by deer; (ii) understanding interactions with other fauna; (iii) measuring impacts on water quality; (iv) assessing economic impacts on agriculture (including as disease vectors); (v) evaluating efficacy of management for mitigating deer impacts; and (vi) quantifying changes in distribution and abundance. Addressing these knowledge gaps will assist the development and prioritisation of cost-effective management strategies and help increase stakeholder support for managing the impacts of deer on Australian ecosystems.",

            "abstractNote": "We identified different distributions of marine nonindigenous species (NIS) and native species on some artificial structures versus natural reefs and using experimental manipulations, revealed some possible causal mechanisms. In well-established subtidal assemblages, numbers of NIS were 1.5–2.5 times greater on pontoons or pilings than on rocky reefs, despite the local species pool of natives being up to 2.5 times greater than that of NIS. Conversely, on reefs and seawalls, numbers of native species were up to three times greater than numbers of NIS. Differential recruitment to different positions and types of surfaces appeared to influence distribution patterns. NIS recruited well to most surfaces, particularly concrete surfaces near the surface of the water, whilst natives occurred infrequently on wooden surfaces. The position of rocky reefs and seawalls close to the shore and to the seabed appeared to make them favourable for the recruitment of natives, but this positioning alone does not hinder the recruitment of NIS. We argue that pontoons and pilings represent beachheads (i.e. entry points for invasion) for many nonindigenous epibiota and so enhance the spread and establishment of NIS in estuaries. Habitat creation in estuaries may, therefore, be a serious threat to native biodiversity.",

However, plants are not adapted to fire per se but to fire regimes. Species can be threatened when humans alter the regime, often by increasing or decreasing fire frequency. Fire-adaptive traits are potentially the result of different evolutionary pathways. Distinguishing between traits that are adaptations originating in response to fire or exaptations originating in response to other factors might not always be possible. However, fire has been a factor throughout the history of land-plant evolution and is not strictly a Neogene phenomenon. Mesozoic fossils show evidence of fire-adaptive traits and, in some lineages, these might have persisted to the present as fire adaptations.",

Wildfires generate open habitats that enable the evolution of a diversity of shade-intolerant plants and animals that have long benefited humans. There are many provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that people obtain from wildfires, and prescribed fires and wildfire management are tools for mimicking the ancestral role of wildfires in an increasingly populated world.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic hybridization in wildlife has been identiﬁed as one of the main causes of genetic homogenization, highlighting the need for identiﬁcation and evaluation of populations at risk. Relocation of wildlife for game management purposes is a widespread practice that may promote the admixing of genetically different populations, subspecies or species. We undertook a large-scale study on the Iberian Peninsula to assess the extent of hybridization in red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa populations, which have been subject to extensive restocking of farm-reared individuals. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique to assess the prevalence of individuals with mtDNA from other species, we examined samples of A. rufa from museum specimens (229), extant wild populations (955) and game farms (530). We found widespread occurrence of chukar partridge Alectoris chukar mtDNA lineages in samples obtained from game farm partridges (63% of game farms) and from wild partridges (45% of populations), but no allochthonous mtDNA lineages were found in museum partridges. We also found that the probability of occurrence and the number of partridges with allochthonous lineages was higher in localities where recent restocking had occurred. In addition, investigation of trends in bag records and the numbers of game farms over the past 30 years suggests that the general decline of wild populations has been accompanied by an increase in game farm facilities. These results suggest that supplemental stocking practices are threatening the integrity of the wild population gene pool. We recommend that rural development policies and associated wildlife management programs focused on maintaining high stock densities for hunting also need to consider the impact of game management on the genetic integrity of game populations.",

Species invasion through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea vastly influences the ecology of the Mediterranean, but the level of reverse migration is assumed to be negligible. We present the first reconstructed flow transport record through the canal during the period 1923–2016. According to this reconstruction, the flow intensity and direction through the canal are strongly influenced by seasonal and long-term sea-level changes, which could also play a role in the characteristics of species migration through it. Our record not only supports previous observations of the unidirectional invasion until the 1980s and the accelerated species migration rates to the Mediterranean ever since, but also suggest that southward migration could have become possible since the early 1980s. The southward flow was primarily enhanced by Indian Ocean cooling and the Eastern Mediterranean Transition in deep water formation during the period 1980–2000. It was then gradually reduced by accelerated sea-level rise in the northern Indian Ocean.",

It provides a very valuable tool by which scientists can assess future potential introductions (or re-introductions) to avoid costly mistakes. It also provides tangible proof of the need for political decision makers to consider good advice and make wise and cautious decisions. Introduced Mammals of the World also provides a comprehensive reference to students of ecological systems management and biological conservation. This book is a companion volume to Introduced Birds of the World, by the same author, published in 1981, and which remains the premier text of its kind in the world more than twenty years after it was published. Introduced Mammals of the World provides the most comprehensive account of the movement of mammals around the world providing details on the date(s) of introduction, the person/agency responsible, the source populations, the location(s) of release, the fate of the introductions, and the impact if known, for over 300 species of mammal.",

            "abstractNote": "We utilize literature surveys to examine the relationship between establishment of exotic species and human or natural disturbances of ecosystems. Of the 133 papers published in 10 ecological journals between 1993 and 1995, 63 reported on field studies involving 299 and 103 successful, nonredundant plant and animal introductions, respectively. Invasions of terrestrial ecosystems dominated (>>97%) the surveyed literature. Disturbance was associated with establishment of exotic species in 56% of these studies, though its importance differed among papers describing plants (68%) and animals (28%). Plants species (86%) were significantly more dependent on disturbance for establishment than were animals (12%). However, animals and plants that were dependent on disturbance for establishment were almost equally dependent (58 versus 68%) on it for range expansion. In a second survey, 402 plant and 103 animal taxa were identified that explicitly linked establishment of exotic species to disturbance. Human activities were attributed with establishment of species in 97 and 57% of these cases, respectively. Common mechanisms associated with establishment of exotic animals included ballast water discharge, intentional releases, and residential development. Establishment of exotic plants was associated with animal activities (e.g., grazing, seed introduction), soil disturbance, forestry, fire, agriculture, and human activities. In contrast to invasions theory, our survey indicates that the association between establishment and spread of exotic species and disturbance ought not be assumed a priori. Some animals repeatedly invade new habitats once geographic barriers are circumvented, indicating that communities may be more receptive to exotic species than previously acknowledged. By contrast, introduced plants established most often in disturbed habitats.",

Hydrologic alterations and biological invasions represent two of the greatest threats to freshwater biota, yet the importance of linkages between these drivers of environmental change remains uncertain. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that impoundments facilitate the introduction and establishment of aquatic invasive species in lake ecosystems. By combining data on boating activity, water body physicochemistry, and geographical distribution of five nuisance invaders in the Laurentian Great Lakes region, we show that non-indigenous species are 2.4 to 300 times more likely to occur in impoundments than in natural lakes, and that impoundments frequently support multiple invaders. Furthermore, comparisons of the contemporary and historical landscapes revealed that impoundments enhance the invasion risk of natural lakes by increasing their proximity to invaded water bodies, highlighting the role of human-altered ecosystems as “stepping-stone” habitats for the continued spread of freshwater invaders.",

            "abstractNote": "Context Invasive mammalian predators are often associated with fragmented landscapes, and can compound the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on native fauna. Knowledge of how invasive predators are influenced by different landscape structures can assist in the mitigation of their impacts. Aims The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of landscape structure and site-scale habitat attributes on the frequency of feral-cat and red-fox detections in fragmented agricultural landscapes. Methods Field surveys of the frequency of red-fox and feral-cat visitation at a site scale were stratified for six different habitat types in six study subregions. The habitat types were large remnant patch interior, large remnant patch edge, small remnant patch, roadside verge, regrowth patch and open agricultural land adjacent to a remnant patch. Sites were centred in a 1-km buffer area from which landscape composition and configuration were calculated. We applied a generalised linear model and an information-theoretic approach to determine the effect size and importance and rank of the explanatory variables on red-fox, feral-cat and pooled cat and fox detection rates. Key results The most important factors influencing detection rates had a positive effect and included: the dominance of cropping in the landscape (cat, fox, pooled cat and fox); and the density of vegetation at a site scale (fox, pooled cat and fox). The number of native habitat patches was also an important factor in the models of red foxes and pooled invasive predators. Conclusion Spatially heterogeneous cropping landscapes incur higher rates of invasive-predator detections than do intact native-woodland and pasture landscapes at the 1-km scale. At a site scale, elevated invasive-predator detections occurred at sites with dense vegetation, characteristic of narrow woodland and the edges of large woodland patches. Implications The research findings highlight that vertebrate pest management needs to target highly fragmented agricultural landscapes that are more likely to have elevated levels of invasive-predator activity. Landscape restoration efforts need to consider the redesign of landscapes to make them less suitable for predators and more hospitable for native wildlife.",

Among the invading species are winter annuals, biennials, cool-season perennials, warm-season perennials, vines, shrubs, and trees. Many of these species have been deliberately introduced and widely planted; some are still used for range improvement, pastures, lawns, and as ornamentals, though many are listed as state or federal noxious weeds. Others have been greatly facilitated by widespread land disturbance. Historically, fire has been a major selective force in the evolution of temperate grasslands. Further, prescribed fire is commonly used as a method of ecological management for native grassland communities as well as in conjunction with restoration efforts. Within this context, it is important to understand how invasive species will interact with natural and prescribed fire regimes.

            "abstractNote": "Context The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a widespread pest in southern Australia and is subject to control over large areas using poison baits to protect both agricultural and ecological assets. Foxes and their prey are often cryptic or in low densities, making it difficult to quantify the efficacy of control programs. Aims We explore the use of remote cameras to estimate the activity and spatial occupancy of foxes and potential mammalian and avian prey species before and after poison baiting in the Goonoo region, central New South Wales. Methods In the first of two studies, we set camera traps at 48 sites in forest and cleared areas, on and off tracks, during autumn 2009. In the second study, we placed camera traps in forest and cleared areas, on tracks only, at 100 sites covering an area of ~441 500 ha during winter 2009. We examined camera-trap rates of all species detected and the activity and site occupancy of a selected subset of species before and after poison baiting. Key results Camera traps indicated greater levels of fox activity on vehicular tracks than off them, with this difference being more marked in forest than in cleared agricultural land. Fox activity and occupancy were greater in agricultural land than in forest, with no effect of baiting detected at the landscape scale. Thirty-five other mammal and bird species were identified from photos, with activity for most being greater on than off tracks. Conclusions No clear effects of fox-baiting were detected on foxes or potential prey species in either study by either activity or occupancy. The lack of a baiting effect may reflect rapid recolonisation by foxes from unbaited areas, as bait placement is generally clustered in agricultural land, or the ready availability of alternative food (lambs or lamb carcasses) in some cleared areas. Implications Our results demonstrate that remote cameras provide a simple means of monitoring changes in fox activity and occupancy at the landscape level, and that these measures have great potential to quantify the success or otherwise of fox-control campaigns on both pest and prey species.",

All these parameters are of importance for understanding the success or the failure of a non-native species. Some characteristics of the recipient area, such as low species diversity, disturbances and climate warming, which are often said to facilitate the introduction process in the terrestrial realm, may be of far lesser importance in the marine environment. In contrast, the role of the vector and of the corridor might have been underestimated.",

We studied the roles of light availability, habitat type, soil disturbance, and seed dispersal in a selectively logged forest in lowland Bolivia where the exotic forage grass Urochloa (Panicum) maxima is abundant on roads and log landings but does not invade felling gaps or unlogged forest. Shade-house trials and seed addition experiments with U. maxima revealed that this C₄ grass thrives in high light but also grows in partial shade (10% full sun, but not 1% full sun), and that felling gaps, but not undisturbed forest, are suitable for grass establishment. To determine if seed dispersal by logging vehicles explains the discrepancy between actual and potential grass recruitment sites, we collected grass seeds that fell from trucks onto log landings located long distances (> 500 m) from established grass populations. Trucks dispersed an estimated 1800 alien grass seeds per log landing during the early dry season; automobiles also transported seeds of grass (135 seeds/vehicle). The seeds collected (and relative abundances) were the exotics U. (Panicum) maxima (97%) and Urochloa (Brachiaria) brizantha (2%), and the pan-tropical weeds Sorghum halapense (1%) and Rottboellia cochinchinensis (0.2%). Grasses invade this forest where disturbance coincides with seed dispersal by motor vehicles, while dispersal limitation apparently prevents invasion of many sites otherwise suitable for grass recruitment (i.e., felling and natural gaps).",

Among the habitat characteristics that render a habitat resistant or susceptible to introductions, species diversity and disturbance are believed to be the most important. It is generally assumed that high species richness renders a habitat resistant to introductions, while disturbances enhance their susceptibility. In the present study, these 2 hypotheses were tested on NW Mediterranean shallow subtidal macrophyte assemblages. Data collection was carried out in early summer 2002 on sub-horizontal rocky substrate at 9 sites along the French Mediterranean coast, 4 undisturbed and 5 highly disturbed. Disturbances include cargo, naval and passenger harbours, and industrial and urban pollution. Relationships between species richness (point diversity), disturbances and the number of introduced macrophytes were analysed. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) there is no relationship between species introductions, diversity and disturbance for the macrophyte assemblages; (2) multifactorial analyses only revealed the biogeographical relationships between the native flora of the sites.",

Here we report that they also undertake expeditions of up to 12.5 km from their home ranges to hunt for short periods over recently burned areas. Cats are especially likely to travel to areas burned at high intensity, probably in response to vulnerability of prey soon after such fires. The movements of journeying cats are highly directed to specific destinations. We argue that the effect of this behaviour is to increase the aggregate impact of cats on vulnerable prey. This has profound implications for conservation, considering the ubiquity of feral cats and global trends of intensified fire regimes.",

            "abstractNote": "Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific literature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injuries organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, movement, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads chang soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the presence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to complement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding construction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.",
