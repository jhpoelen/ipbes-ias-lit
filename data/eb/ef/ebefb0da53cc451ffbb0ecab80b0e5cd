There are no written records of this species being transported to or escaping from captivity in South America and there is enough evidence to suggest that individuals are capable of making the crossing from Africa to the Americas unaided. Since long-distance movements of species are partly dependent on meteorological events we analyze the possibility of B. ibis crossing the Atlantic Ocean aided only by wind conditions evaluating existing theories and shedding light on their feasibility through the analysis of weather patterns and atmospheric circulation. Zonal and meridional wind components taken from the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project were used to calculate trajectories between different points along the West African coast and South America between 1871 and 1920 in two seasons (March-April and September-October). From a total of 192,864 trajectories analyzed, 1,695 with origin in the west coast of Africa reached the NE coast of South America or the Caribbean islands in less than a week (successful trajectories). The probability of these successful trajectories originating in Central Africa was above 0.65 for the majority of the destinations analyzed. Particularly, in Guyana and Suriname where B. ibis was first sighted, the probability of the origin being Central Africa was 0.84, most of them occurring during March. Several weather events favored not only the colonization of the Cattle Egret but also its establishment and spread all throughout the Americas.",

            "abstractNote": "Desert dust seeds distant lands and waters with minerals as well as micro-organisms raising the question of whether this ancient phenomenon also spreads pathogens across the globe. Severe dust storms require strong winds blowing over land-masses that are largely devoid of vegetation, effectively limiting the scope for winds to raise pathogens into the air. Nevertheless, changing patterns of land-use, often driven by belligerency, result in refugees spreading to areas that were previously deemed barely habitable. With the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a number of sand/dust samples were collected from the Republic of Chad, some near refugee camps, others further removed from human influence. In parallel studies, we documented the micro-organisms present in these samples and used a number of the isolates here to test the effect of environmental constraints on their ability to survive intercontinental flight. We also added traditional pathogens to the palette of microbes and tested the effects of UV irradiation, desiccation and temperature on survival of both bacteria and fungi. A clear trend was obvious-those microbes that are coloured or able to form conidia or spores (in other words, those that are native to deserts) were well able to resist the imposed stresses. On the other hand, most pathogens were more sensitive to stresses than the environmental isolates. Toxin production in two species of Aspergillus was also investigated. Short-term desiccation (simulating environmental conditions during intercontinental travel) of sand amended with fungal spores containing sterigmatocystin leads to increased mycotoxin contents, but significant mycotoxin production was only possible under growth-permissive conditions, e. g. at higher humidity. It thus seems likely that an ever-decreasing fraction of the initial pathogen load survives as the dust recedes from its desert source and that those organisms that land on other continents are highly enriched in desert dwellers.",

Without such perturbations, this current represents a potential barrier to the transport of planktonic lionfish eggs and larvae across the Straits of Florida. We further show that once lionfish became established in the Bahamas, hurricanes significantly hastened their spread through the island chain. We gain these insights through: (1) an analysis of the direction and velocity of simulated ocean currents during the passage of hurricanes through the Florida Straits and (2) the development of a biophysical model that incorporates the tolerances of lionfish to ocean climate, their reproductive strategy, and duration that the larvae remain viable in the water column. On the basis of this work, we identify 23 occasions between the years 1992 and 2006 in which lionfish were provided the opportunity to breach the Florida Current. We also find that hurricanes during this period increased the rate of spread of lionfish through the Bahamas by more than 45% and magnified its population by at least 15%. Beyond invasive lionfish, we suggest that extreme weather events such as hurricanes likely help to homogenize the gene pool for all Caribbean marine species susceptible to transport.",

            "abstractNote": "Non-native, invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass-ﬁre cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantiﬁed resulting changes in ﬁre activity at local scales, and many have speculated about larger scales, regional alterations to ﬁre regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the inﬂuence of large-scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on ﬁre size, duration, spread rate, and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin, USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2000–2009 and to ﬁre extents recorded by the USGS registry of ﬁres from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6% of the central Great Basin (650 000 km2). MODIS records show that 13% of these cheatgrass-dominated lands burned, resulting in a ﬁre return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.5–6% burned). During the 1990s, this difference was even more extreme, with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16% of cheatgrass burned compared to 1–5% of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest ﬁres, comprising 24% of the land area of the 50 largest ﬁres recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore, multi-date ﬁres that burned across multiple vegetation types were signiﬁcantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally, cheatgrass ﬁres showed a strong interannual response to wet years, a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional ﬁre regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades, this study is the ﬁrst to document recent cheatgrass-driven ﬁre regimes at a regional scale.",

We found strong evidence of biotic resistance: species richness and community\nbiomass were negatively related with invasion success; invader biomass was greater in plant communities\nfrom China than from Mexico. Harvesting time had a greater effect on invasion success\nin plant communities from China than on those from Mexico. Functional and phylogenetic distances\nboth correlated with invasion success and more functionally distant communities were more\neasily invaded. The effects of plant-soil fungi and plant allelochemical interactions on invasion\nsuccess were species-specific.",

            "abstractNote": "Intensification of weather extremes is currently emerging as one of the most important facets of climate change. Research on extreme events (“event-focused” in contrast to “trend-focused”) has increased in recent years and, in 2004, accounted for one-fifth of the experimental climate-change studies published. Numerous examples, ranging from microbiology and soil science to biogeography, demonstrate how extreme weather events can accelerate shifts in species composition and distribution, thereby facilitating changes in ecosystem functioning. However, assessing the importance of extreme events for ecological processes poses a major challenge because of the very nature of such events: their effects are out of proportion to their short duration. We propose that extreme events can be characterized by statistical extremity, timing, and abruptness relative to the life cycles of the organisms affected. To test system response to changing magnitude and frequency of weather events, controlled experiments are useful tools. These experiments provide essential insights for science and for societies that must develop coping strategies for such events. Here, we discuss future research needs for climate-change experiments in ecology. For illustration, we describe an experimental plan showing how to meet the challenge posed by changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme events.",

            "abstractNote": "Anticipated increases in the frequency and severity of wildfire may threaten the persistence of native salmonid populations in headwater streams in western North America. This study used extensive pre- and postfire data to assess whether wildfire leads to hypothesized declines in native westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus populations along with increases in the prevalence and abundance of nonnative brook trout S. fontinalis. Postfire cutthroat trout density was negatively correlated with the proportion of basin area that burned at moderate to high severity, but the declines in density after fires were less pronounced for bull trout and brook trout. Recovery of cutthroat trout was generally rapid in severely affected reaches. Contrary to expectation, there was no evidence of a marked increase in abundance or invasion by brook trout after wildfire. Brook trout exhibited the most severe declines in debris flow–affected reaches among all species and exhibited less recovery in severely burned reaches than did cutthroat trout. Increased stream temperature was the most significant habitat change that followed wildfire, the mean maximum water temperature during summer months increasing by 2–6°C in severely burned reaches. In contrast, burned area percentage was unrelated to large woody debris density, the percentage of surface fines, substrate diversity, or the percentage of pool habitat. The characteristically high variability in fish and habitat responses to wildfire will continue to pose a challenge for the understanding and management of fire in aquatic ecosystems.

We address this topic by focusing on invasive alien ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae; known also as ladybugs). Humans appear directly or indirectly responsible for all or most ladybird invasions. Factors hypothesized to have promoted ladybird invasions include genetic diversity (e.g., for polymorphism), phenotypic plasticity, adaptation and genetic shift, generalized diet and habitat preferences, flexible life history and reproduction, large body size, and release from enemies. Factors such as climate, habitat and prey availability, and biotic resistance may sometimes prevent or slow ladybird invasions. Indigenous species (e.g., herbivores) may suffer from invasions, and biological control programs may be affected. Species of indigenous ladybirds throughout the world are reported to have declined in abundance following ladybird invasions, with increased competition and/or intraguild predation most often hypothesized or inferred. Similar recent studies especially of ground beetles (Carabidae) also make clear the potential of invasive alien predatory Coleoptera to disrupt invaded natural and agricultural ecosystems.",

We analysed the relationships between four invasive alien fleshy-fruited plants, Clidemia hirta, Rubus alceifolius, Lantana camara, Schinus terebinthifolius, and an invasive alien bird, the red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus introduced to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).",

Disturbances such as ﬁre can promote the proliferation of exotic species in native plant communities. In this study we analyze the effect of ﬁre on reproductive phenology in three native species (a shrub: Berberis buxifolia and two small trees: Maytenus boaria and Schinus patagonicus) and in an exotic shrub (Rosa rubiginosa). Flowering and fruiting phenology was monitored in neighbouring burned and unburned forests. The shrubs ﬂowered and fruited in both sites, but the small trees did so only in the unburned site. There is no overlapping in the ﬂowering and fruiting phenophases between the natives and the exotic species. Therefore, they do not compete in resource offering to pollinators and seed dispersers. Consequently, R. rubiginosa has a ‘competition-free’ space enhanced by ﬁre, from the reproductive phenology perspective.",

Mitigating this debt will require the development of a predictive framework that improves our understanding of the factors causing decline of native biodiversity in urban areas. I argue that nitrogen is a common currency around which such a predictive framework could be built. I first summarise the evidence that shows the probable extent of nitrogen enrichment in urban ecosystems. I then review the body of empirical evidence that describes how nitrogen enrichment affects ecosystem process and function. By unifying these two bodies of empirical evidence, I generate a series of testable hypotheses that may allow for a better understanding of native biodiversity loss in urban areas.",

The process of introduction now exposes species to novel conditions which may select for tolerance to a contaminant. Invader establishment success is influenced by both the supply of invasive propagules and disturbance. Therefore, it is important to understand whether tolerance to an anthropogenic disturbance, such as contamination, can change the parameters of supply in a way that inadvertently augments the invasion process. 2. To test whether the invasion process is influenced by a widespread contaminant, we investigated how recruitment of the invasive hull-fouling bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata is affected by exposure to copper-based antifouling paint. We quantified settlement patterns in control and copper environments and then assessed post-settlement survival and fitness components. 3. Copper significantly increased total recruitment success despite greater post-settlement mortality. Surviving recruits differed morphologically, with shorter ancestrulae and smaller colonies in high copper treatments. These results show a strong positive affiliation between larval W. subtorquata and high levels of copper although there are associated fitness costs. 4. Syntheses and applications. We found a direct positive effect of contamination on recruitment of a common invasive species. This process is likely to be relevant to other non-indigenous species (NIS) that exhibit a positive affiliation with metal contamination. Copper can potentially enhance success at multiple stages of the invasion process, including facilitating transport and establishment, by increasing the supply and retention of individuals into anthropogenically disturbed environments. Identification of tolerance to contamination as a species trait may also aid in predicting a species invasiveness and spread. Management of metal pollution through remediation and alternative copper-free antifouling techniques would help prevent the spread and establishment of many marine NIS.",

            "abstractNote": "Human activity in the last century has led to a significant increase in nitrogen (N) emissions and atmospheric deposition. This N deposition has reached a level that has caused or is likely to cause alterations to the structure and function of many ecosystems across the United States. One approach for quantifying the deposition of pollution that would be harmful to ecosystems is the determination of critical loads. A critical load is defined as the input of a pollutant below which no detrimental ecological effects occur over the long-term according to present knowledge. The objectives of this project were to synthesize current research relating atmospheric N deposition to effects on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the United States, and to estimate associated empirical N critical loads. The receptors considered included freshwater diatoms, mycorrhizal fungi, lichens, bryophytes, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees. Ecosystem impacts included: (1) biogeochemical responses and (2) individual species, population, and community responses. Biogeochemical responses included increased N mineralization and nitrification (and N availability for plant and microbial uptake), increased gaseous N losses (ammonia volatilization, nitric and nitrous oxide from nitrification and denitrification), and increased N leaching. Individual species, population, and community responses included increased tissue N, physiological and nutrient imbalances, increased growth, altered root : shoot ratios, increased susceptibility to secondary stresses, altered fire regime, shifts in competitive interactions and community composition, changes in species richness and other measures of biodiversity, and increases in invasive species. The range of critical loads for nutrient N reported for U.S. ecoregions, inland surface waters, and freshwater wetlands is 1–39 kg N·ha−1·yr−1, spanning the range of N deposition observed over most of the country. The empirical critical loads for N tend to increase in the following sequence for different life forms: diatoms, lichens and bryophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and trees. The critical load approach is an ecosystem assessment tool with great potential to simplify complex scientific information and communicate effectively with the policy community and the public. This synthesis represents the first comprehensive assessment of empirical critical loads of N for major ecoregions across the United States.",

Location Europe. Methods Numbers of naturalized alien species of plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern of occurrence of alien species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insularity, latitude or area. Results The highest numbers of alien plant and insect species were found in human-made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers of alien plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. Mires, bogs and fens, grassland, heathland and scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions of alien species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number of alien species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine-tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainland–island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions There are two ecologically distinct groups of alien species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat-specific numbers of alien species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and the same holds true for insects and plants.",

In this study, large-sized land snails (>5 mm) were surveyed using transect sampling at nine restored landfill sites and nine corresponding nature sites in the East Midlands region of the UK, during 2008. The effect of restoration was investigated by examining the composition, richness and diversity (Shannon index) of land snail species in relation to habitat and landscape structure. Thirteen macro-snail species were recorded in total, and rarefied species richness and diversity at restored landfill sites was not found to be statistically different from that of reference sites. One third of the snail species at restored landfill sites accounting for 30% of their total abundance were non-native species. Soil electrical conductivity was the strongest predictor of richness and diversity of land snails. Road density was found to be positively related to snail species diversity. Given the high percentage of introduced species at study sites, further research is needed to elucidate management implications of restored landfill sites and dynamics of native vs. non-native species.",

Composting has a number of advantages, including economic benefits, improvement of soil properties through the use of compost, reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers, and minimization of environmental pollution. Composting on a landfill surface appears to be an economical solution that can help close the waste loop and material cycle. In this study, a composting plant located on a landfill surface was analysed. The main objective of the research was to identify the species of plants growing in the organic fraction of municipal solid waste in temporary storage, in the composting plant, and in maturing compost located in a reclaimed plot at the landfill site. During monitoring, 88 plant species were identified altogether. It was observed that compost can become a source of weed infestation. To control the presence of weeds in the compost, basic principles of composting are to be followed to reduce the quantity of weed seeds. The thermophilic phase must occur to reduce the viability of seeds in the input materials and sufficient moisture must be ensured during the composting process. When these principles are strictly observed and the stored compost is maintained without vegetation, the supply of seeds in the compost will be low, and the undesirable spread of plant species to adjacent areas will be controlled. The results showed that the use of the obtained compost did not result in the propagation of weed species. This study demonstrates that composting on a reclaimed landfill offers various advantages such as a closed waste management cycle, coverage of the active landfill body, and fertilisation of the reclaimed part of the landfill.",

            "abstractNote": "Coastal infrastructure provides extensive habitat for marine nonindigenous species (“NIS”), especially biofouling species. Ecosystem transplants can arise when static maritime structures (“SMS”) are relocated under slow towing speeds following long periods of biofouling accumulation. Translocations of SMS occur more often than acknowledged and represent a high-risk vector of marine NIS that is largely overlooked and unregulated. We compiled geolocations and movement patterns for oil platforms, derelict/obsolete vessels, barges, dry docks, floating lodges, homes and docks, aquaculture gear and buoys for the NE Pacific coast. We related these data to NIS richness within the region and to global examples of SMS movement. Our review and synthesis of SMS, paired with biofouling surveys before and after dock towing events, reveal the growing NIS vector opportunities resulting from sprawling coastal infrastructure. As coastal development continues apace in the Anthropocene, this emerging management challenge will require strong frameworks and workable solutions for a global issue that currently lacks incentives to prevent species transfers and invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "Deepwater exploration has been developed for more than 40 years since 1975; generally, its exploration history can be divided into the beginning stage (1975–1984), the early stage (1985–1995) and the rapid development stage (1996-now). Currently, deepwater areas have become the hotspot of global oil and gas exploration, and they are also one of the most important fields of oil and gas increase in reserves and production all over the world. In 40 years, global deepwater oil and gas discoveries are mainly distributed along five deepwater basin groups which are characterized by “three vertical and two horizontal” groups: (1) In deepwater basins of the Atlantic Ocean, giant discoveries of oil are mainly concentrated in Brazil, West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, and significant discoveries of natural gas are mainly on the west coast of Norway in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean; (2) In deepwater basins of the East African continental margin, a group of giant gas fields has been found in the Rovuma Basin and Tanzania Basin; (3) In deepwater basins of the West Pacific Ocean, giant discoveries of oil and gas are mainly concentrated in the South China Sea and Southeast Asian waters; (4) The deepwater basins of the Neo-Tethys Region are rich in gas, and the most important gas discoveries are mainly distributed in the northwest shelf of Australia and the eastern Mediterranean; and (5) In deepwater basins around the Arctic Pole, major discoveries of oil and gas have been only found in deepwater areas of the Barents sea. Global deepwater oil resources are mainly concentrated in the middle and south sections of the Atlantic Ocean. Deepwater gas resources are relatively widely spread and mainly distributed in the northern part of Atlantic Ocean deepwater basins, the deepwater basins of East Africa, the deepwater basins of the Neo-Tethys region and the deepwater basins around the Arctic Pole. There will be six domains for future oil-gas exploration of global deepwater basins which are characterized by “two old and four new” domains; specifically, “two old” domains referring to the Atlantic offshore deepwater basins and offshore deepwater basins of the Neo-Tethys structural domain, where the exploration degree is relatively high, and the potential is still great. While the “four new” domains stand for pre-salt and ultra deepwater basin formations, offshore deepwater basins surrounding the North Pole area and West Pacific offshore deepwater basins and the new fields will be the main fields of deepwater oil and gas exploration in the future.",

            "abstractNote": "Communities subject to stress, including those with low invasibility, may be dominated by exotic generalist species. African grasses are aggressive invasive species in Neotropical savannas, where their response to abiotic stress remains unknown. We assessed the role of waterlogging and canopy closure on the presence, abundance and reproductive tillering of African and native grasses in a Neotropical savanna in southeastern Brazil. We obtained abundance and reproductive tillering data of exotic (Melinis minutiflora, Melinis repens and Urochloa decumbens) and common native grasses in 20 sites. We also determined the groundwater depth, soil surface water potential and canopy cover at these sites. The grass species generally had a low frequency and performed poorly where soil remained waterlogged throughout the year, except for two native species. Most native species were exclusive to either well-drained savannas or better drained wet grasslands. However, two species (Loudetiopsis chrysothrix and Trachypogon spicatus) occurred in both vegetation types. Two exotic species (M. minutiflora and M. repens) were less common but demonstrated reasonable performance in wet grasslands, possibly due to their root system plasticity. Furthermore, U. decumbens had a lower occurrence, density and reproductive tillering at these sites, but was successful at sites where the groundwater level was slightly deeper. Although the favourable water regime in the savannas increases their invasibility in general, resistance to invasion by African grasses may be greater at microsites with high canopy closure, where these species showed lower performance and did not affect the abundance of co-occurring native grasses. In summary, the Brazilian savanna becomes more susceptible to the spread of African grasses when disturbances decrease canopy closure or lower rainfall associated with climate change reduces the average groundwater depth and consequently releases invasive species from soil waterlogging in grasslands.",

            "abstractNote": "To reduce the risk of extinction due to climate change, some ecologists have suggested human-aided translocation of species, or assisted migration (AM), to areas where climate is projected to become suitable. Such intentional movement, however, may create new invasive species if successful introductions grow out of control and cause ecologic or economic damage. We assessed this risk by surveying invasive species in the United States and categorizing invaders based on origin. Because AM will involve moving species on a regional scale within continents (i.e., range shifts), we used invasive species with an intracontinental origin as a proxy for species that would be moved through AM. We then determined whether intracontinental invasions were more prevalent or harmful than intercontinental invasions. Intracontinental invasions occurred far less frequently than invasions from other continents, but they were just as likely to have had severe effects. Fish and crustaceans pose a particularly high threat of intracontinental invasion. We conclude that the risk of AM to create novel invasive species is small, but assisted species that do become invasive could have large effects. Past experience with species reintroductions may help inform policy regarding AM. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.",

Herein we provide an overview of the challenges inherent in efforts to restore mined landscapes to functioning forest ecosystems and present a synthesis of recent progress using examples from North America, Europe and Australia. We end with recommendations for further elaboration of the Forestry Reclamation Approach emphasizing: (1) Landform reconstruction modelled on natural systems and creation of topographic heterogeneity at a variety of scales; (2) Use and placement of overburden, capping materials and organic amendments to facilitate soil development processes and create a suitable rooting medium for trees; (3) Alignment of landform, topography, overburden, soil and tree species to create a diversity of target ecosystem types; (4) Combining optimization of stock type and planting techniques with early planting of a diversity of tree species; (5) Encouraging natural regeneration as much as possible; (6) Utilizing direct placement of forest floor material combined with seeding of native species to rapidly re-establish native forest understory vegetation; (7) Selective on-going management to encourage development along the desired successional trajectory. Successful restoration of forest ecosystems after severe mining disturbance will be facilitated by a regulatory framework that acknowledges and accepts variation in objectives and outcomes.",

            "abstractNote": "Open-pit mining causes severe land degradation in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Vegetation restoration on the degraded land with open-pit mining is challenging due to great physical and chemical condition changes of the post-mined landscape. In this study, we compared the vegetation community composition and environmental factors along three disturbance gradients (mining area, restoration area, and control area) in four typical open-pit mine types (phosphate, zinc, tin, and iron sites). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that there are significant differences in the vegetation communities along three gradients for these mine sites. Quality species were selected by indicator species analysis for vegetation restoration as follows: Chloris virgata Sw. and Artemisia princeps Pamp at the phosphate site; Coriaria nepalensis Wall., Artemisia princeps Pamp, and Picris hieracioides L. at the zinc site; Artemisia princeps Pamp at the tin site; and Panicum brevifolium L. at the iron site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordination and Monte Carlo permutation tests were further used to determine the effects of environmental factors on vegetation diversity. The results showed that Cd, As, Zn, Pb, TC, and altitude all had significant effects on vegetation diversity (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that the integrated effects of these variables on vegetation were greater in the mining area than in the other two gradients based on the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion. These results suggest that any plans for vegetation restoration in open-pit mining areas should take disturbance intensity, mine types, and critical environmental variables into account.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), vector of several emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies. Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0 degrees C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11 degrees C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and 1 degrees C, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: MODIS satellite LST data are useful for accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas, predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas.",

On the Atlantico Department beaches (Colombia) woody debris and plastic litter dominate (86%) the types of refuse on the beaches with their densities ranging from 0.82-1.72 items m(-1). Such litter and woody debris generate the optimal conditions for floating colonizers. In this work, 26 beaches were surveyed, and 16 of them (62%) were found to have marine fauna using litter and woody debris as a substrate for potential rafting and dispersal. Serpulidae polychaete tubes, goose barnacles Lepas (Anatifa) anserifera Linnaeus, 1767, and the bryozoans Arbopercula tenella (Hincks, 1880), Arbopercula angulata (Levinsen, 1909), plus three unidentified species were found colonizing woody debris, seeds, plastic and glass bottles. These findings of woody debris and litter facilitating the arrival and dispersal of non-native species on this coast, demonstrate that preventive management of such refuse in coastal habitats goes beyond simply preserving coastal esthetics.",

The remediation strategies to overcome the problem of environmental degradation should be assorted for its ecological impacts. Phytoremediation is a green technology for the removal of pollutants from various environmental compartments by employing green plants. An ideal phytoremediation plant candidate should possess some characteristic features such as exhibiting stronger growth traits with high biomass, unpalatable nature, exuberant root system, hyper accumulation of target contaminants accompanied with stress tolerance attributes. The growth of natural vegetation is prevented by the barren and uncongenial conditions prevailing in the contaminated sites, but however invasive plants are capable of establishing themselves on those sites due to their opportunistic incursive nature. Since, it is hard to eradicate an invasive species once after their establishment in a new habitat or ecosystem, they can possibly be controlled by sustainable management through the way of exploiting them in contaminant remediation, thus phytoremediation. Therefore, it is of foremost requisite to determine the ability of invasive species in offering various ecologically viable services including contaminant remediation through scientific exploration. In this review, the implications of using invasive plants in contaminant remediation with accompanying challenges and scopes involved are discussed with the available volume of literatures in contaminant remediation using plants, especially the invasive plants.",

A review of the invasion history is presented as well as new data on the spatial and inter-annual variability of this species and its relation to salinity, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. A short literature review of the morphological characters of the Baltic P. minimum is also included. From 1993 to 2002, P. minimum was a regular component of the summer and autumn plankton flora of the Baltic Sea proper and the Gulf of Finland. Its abundance varied considerably inter-annually and did not show any clear trends during the period. Abundance of P. minimum was significantly higher in the nutrient-enriched Bay of Mecklenburg (German coast) and the southern Baltic proper than in the central and northern Baltic proper and the Gulf of Finland, where its abundance was mostly sparse. In coastal waters P. minimum occasionally reached densities of several million cells per litre and dominated phytoplankton biomass (>90%). Abundance of the Baltic P. minimum was generally not related to salinity or temperature. It could be a dominant species at both high and low salinity (over 15 and 4.8 PSU), and its temperature range was broad (from 2.7 to 26.4°C). However, dense populations usually occurred from July to October at temperatures above 10°C. Further, there appears to be a positive correlation between the success of P. minimum in the Baltic Sea and high concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrogen. This tolerant and morphologically variable dinoflagellate seems to be a morphospecies without subtaxa, which can expand its range in the Baltic Sea, especially in nutrient-rich coastal waters.",

            "abstractNote": "Mining regions undergo abrupt and extensive land use change, the impacts of which pose management challenges for mining companies and regulatory agencies. In this study we investigated 20 years of land use change in Brazil's Iron Quadrangle (QF) mining region. We classified remote sensing images to produce land use maps and conducted a Land Change analysis to investigate the causes and consequences of observed changes. The QF underwent extensive land use change between 1990 and 2010, including deforestation, plantation expansion, urbanization and mine expansion. Comparing our results with those of surrounding non-mining landscapes illustrated important differences. For example, QF contained additional highly profitable land uses, including mining and plantation forestry, which were driven by globalized markets for mineral resources. This finding suggests processes of land use change within mining regions are distinct from those found elsewhere and, as such, land management policies should reflect this. We also hypothesized four generalizations regarding these processes: 1) the direct footprints of mining expands over time, 2) the offsite footprints of mining are extensive and also often expanding, 3) the direct and indirect land used by mines causes environmental and social impacts, some of which are not captured by current management approaches, and 4) the footprints of mining (and associated impacts) are driven by global factors, many of which are uncontrollable by local land holders and regional land management plans and policies. We describe and discuss these generalizations, drawing on published evidence from other mining regions to illustrate both their generality and implications for land management.",

            "abstractNote": "Tamarix usneoides (Tamaricaceae) is a species native to southern Africa where it is currently being used in the mines for phytoremediation. Tamarix aphylla, Tamarix ramosissima, Tamarix chinensis, and Tamarix parviflora have been reported as exotic species in South Africa, with T. ramosissima declared invasive. The alien invasive T. ramosissima is hypothesized to be hybridizing with the indigenous T. usneoides. Accurate identification of Tamarix is of great importance in southern Africa because of the invasive potential of T. ramosissima and also the potential usefulness of T. usneoides. In this study, nuclear DNA sequence markers (ITS1 and ITS2 regions), together with the plastid marker trnS–trnG, are used to identify the genetic distinctiveness of Tamarix species and their putative hybrids. Phylogenies based on the ITS and trnS–trnG regions revealed that the indigenous T. usneoides is genetically distinct from the exotic species, which, however, could not clearly be separated from their closely related hybrids. The lack of congruence (p>0.0001) between the ITS and trnS–trnG phylogenies suggests that there is high incidence of hybridization in Tamarix populations in South Africa. Importantly, molecular diagnosis of Tamarix was able to identify hybrids using polymorphisms and phylogenetic signals. Close to 45% of Tamarix genotypes were hybrids with more than 50% of them occurring on the mines. Spread of Tamarix hybrids in South Africa through phytoremediation could enhance invasiveness. Therefore, the outcome of this study will ensure that only pure indigenous T. usneoides is propagated for planting on the mines in South Africa and that a proper control measure for the alien invasive Tamarix is used. Interestingly, the molecular diagnosis of Tamarix species supported the preliminary morphological identification of the species using eight key characters. However, the molecular markers used were not informative enough to separate hybrids from their closely related parent species. Hybrids were more reliably identified using polymorphisms than morphological features.",

We analysed 159 articles including 98 species that are present in rubbish dumps. Studies come from all over the world (including Antarctica), but mainly from Europe, North America and Africa. Impacts reported on vertebrates were manly considered positive (72.6%) but around a quarter showed negative impacts. Rubbish dumps provide food resources that may improve body condition, enhance reproductive performance and abundance, improve survival rate, alter movements, and they can be an important sustenance for some endangered species. However, these places increase the risk of pathogen infections and poisoning, can be responsible for the spread of introduced-invasive species and favour conflicts between humans and animals that use them. Moreover, species that take advantage of these sites can produce negative impacts on others that do not use them. Worldwide increase in waste production makes this novel ecosystem important on shaping ecological communities. Therefore, the spatial and temporal effects of rubbish dumps on wildlife should be evaluated more deeply at a worldwide scale considering current differences in waste production from developing to developed countries.",

Whereas some components of global change, such as rising CO2, usually promote invasion, other components, such as changing temperature and precipitation, can help or hinder plant invasion. Additionally, experimental studies and models suggest that invasive plants often respond unpredictably to multiple components of global change acting in concert. Such variability adds uncertainty to existing risk assessments and other predictive tools. Here, we review current knowledge about relationships between plant invasion and global change, and highlight research needed to improve forecasts of invasion risk. Managers should be prepared for both expansion and contraction of invasive plants due to global change, leading to increased risk or unprecedented opportunities for restoration.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic disturbance is considered a risk factor in the establishment of nonindigenous species (NIS); however, few studies have investigated the role of anthropogenic disturbance in facilitating the establishment and spread of NIS in marine environments. A baseline survey of native and NIS was undertaken in conjunction with a manipulative experiment to determine the effect that heavy metal pollution had on the diversity and invasibility of marine hard-substrate assemblages. The study was repeated at two sites in each of two harbours in New South Wales, Australia. The survey sampled a total of 47 sessile invertebrate taxa, of which 15 (32%) were identiﬁed as native, 19 (40%) as NIS, and 13 (28%) as cryptogenic. Increasing pollution exposure decreased native species diversity at all study sites by between 33% and 50%. In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant change in the numbers of NIS. Percentage cover was used as a measure of spatial dominance, with increased pollution exposure leading to increased NIS dominance across all sites. At three of the four study sites, assemblages that had previously been dominated by natives changed to become either extensively dominated by NIS or equally occupied by native and NIS alike. No single native or NIS was repeatedly responsible for the observed changes in native species diversity or NIS dominance at all sites. Rather, the observed effects of pollution were driven by a diverse range of taxa and species. These ﬁndings have important implications for both the way we assess pollution impacts, and for the management of NIS. When monitoring the response of assemblages to pollution, it is not sufﬁcient to simply assess changes in community diversity. Rather, it is important to distinguish native from NIS components since both are expected to respond differently. In order to successfully manage current NIS, we ﬁrst need to address levels of pollution within recipient systems in an effort to bolster the resilience of native communities to invasion.",

Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a ‘systematic trend’. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial ‘sign-switching’ responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates ‘very high confidence’ (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.",

Knowing this, national park staff at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in the southwestern United States had a program in place for early detection of the non-native, invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Upon finding the mussel in January 2007, managers moved quickly to access funding and the best available science to implement a response. Managers considered four options--doing nothing, closing the park, restricting movement on the lakes, and educating and enforcing park visitors--and decided to focus on education and enforcing existing laws. Nonetheless, quagga spread throughout the park and soon began to appear throughout the western United States. I examined why efforts to control the expansion failed and determined the general lessons to be learned from this case. Concentrating human visitation on the lakes through land-use zoning opened a pathway for invasion, reduced management options, and led to the rapid spread of quagga. To reconcile competing mandates to protect nature and provide recreation, zoning in parks has become a common practice worldwide. It reduces stress on some areas of a park by restricting and thus concentrating human activity in particular areas. Concentrating the human activity in one area does three things: cements pathways that repeatedly import and export vectors of non-native invasive species; creates the disturbed area necessary to enable non-native invasive species to gain a foothold; and, establishes a source of invasions that, without appropriate controls, can quickly spread to a park's wilderness areas.",

Seasonality of precipitation and fires regulate the N cycle in these water-limited ecosystems, where dry N deposition dominates. Nitrogen accumulation in soils and on plant surfaces results in peaks of availability with the first winter rains. Decoupling between N flushes and plant demand promotes losses via leaching and gas emissions. Differences in P availability may control the response to N inputs and susceptibility to exotic plant invasion. Invasive grasses accumulate as fuel during the dry season, altering fire regimes. California and the Mediterranean Basin are the most threatened by N deposition; however, there is limited evidence for N deposition impacts outside of California. Consequently, more research is needed to determine critical loads for each region and vegetation type based on the most sensitive elements, such as changes in lichen species composition and N cycling.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasion by annual grasses, such as cheatgrass, into the western U.S. sagebrush-steppe is a major concern of ecologists and resource managers. Maintaining or improving ecosystem health depends on our ability to protect or re-establish functioning, desired plant communities. In frequently disturbed ecosystems, nutrient status and the relative ability of species to acquire nutrients are important drivers of invasion, retrogression, and succession. Thus, these processes can potentially be modified to direct plant community dynamics toward a desired plant community. The overall objective of this review paper is to provide the ecological background of invasion by exotic plants and propose a concept to facilitate the use of soil nitrogen (N) management to achieve desired plant communities that resist invasion. Based on the literature, we propose a model that predicts the outcome of community dynamics based on N availability. The model predicts that at low N levels, native mid- and late-seral species are able to successfully out-compete early-seral and invasive annual species up to some optimal level. However, at some increased level of N, early-seral species and invasive annual grasses are able to grow and reproduce more successfully than native mid- and late-seral species. At the high end of N availability to plants, the community is most susceptible to invasion and ultimately, increased fire frequency. Soil N level can be managed by altering microbial communities, grazing, mowing, and using cover crops and bridge species during restoration. In these cases, management may be more sustainable since the underlying cause of invasion and succession is modified in the management process.Nomenclature: Cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum L. BROTE.",

This paper consists of a literature review of 17 species of planktonic algae, with a discussion of taxonomic problems. We also clarify whether these 17 species are non-native, invasive or cryptogenic species, with an indication whether they had been recognised as ‘alien’ in Europe. According to our observations, areas colonized by small and alien algal species, were anthropogenically altered. There were: systems with heated waters (‘heated islands’), which imitated tropical conditions; highly eutrophic to hypereutrophic water ecosystems, easily colonized by alien species, fishponds with intense fish cultivation, where alien species of fish are/had been introduced, which carried also other alien organisms; and inland water ecosystems with high salinity or high conductivity e.g. pits inundated by mine waters, imitating sea or brackish conditions acting as hubs of migration of alien species adapted to brackish or saline waters. We have prepared a map showing areas inhabited by alien species, both of documented places and hypothetical ones, where we would expect alien species to occur.",

Such expansion may threaten human health, and food security via effects on animal and crop health. Here we quantify the potential impact of climate change on a vector-borne disease of livestock, bluetongue, which has emerged in northern Europe in response to climate change2–4, affecting tens of thousands of farms at huge financial cost and causing the deaths of millions of animals5. We derive future disease risk trends for northern Europe, and use a detailed spatial transmission model6 to simulate outbreaks in England and Wales under future climatic conditions, using an ensemble of five downscaled general circulation models7. By 2100, bluetongue risk extends further north, the transmission season lengthens by up to three months and outbreaks are larger on average. A 1 in 20-year outbreak at present-day temperatures becomes typical by the 2070s under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario. However, animal movement restrictions are sufficient to prevent truly devastating outbreaks. Disease transmission uncertainty dominates over climate uncertainty, even at the longest prediction timescales. Our results suggest that efficient detection and control measures to limit the spread of vector-borne diseases will be increasingly vital in future, warmer climates.",

Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change.

            "abstractNote": "1 Increased occurrence of high-flow events as a result of climate change may affect the dispersal success of an invasive plant species Mimulus guttatus and may result in range expansion. Predicted changes in climate point to a continuation of the recent observed trends in increased precipitation and high-flow events in Northern Europe. 2 The study focused on the dispersal characteristics of M. guttatus, and especially the roles of vegetative fragmentation with increasing water velocities, subsequent fragment survival, regeneration and colonization, as well as the buoyancy, survival and germination success of seeds. 3 M. guttatus was found to fragment readily under velocities typical of high flow conditions and even small fragments had high survival, regeneration and colonization capacity. 4 Large numbers of small (< 0.02 mg) seeds are produced; however, seeds have a short buoyancy period so the timing and magnitude of high-flow events is crucial in determining potential dispersal distances. Seeds germinate readily both in water and on sand with an average 33% germination within 9 days. 5 The dual strategy of dispersal by vegetative fragments and seeds, together with the opportunity of dispersing the two types of propagules during different periods of the year, facilitates local dominance by M. guttatus as well as long-distance colonization. As a result, the rate of spread of M. guttatus into inundation communities along rivers is likely to increase with more frequent high-flow events, especially if these coincide with the growing season. Thus, predicting the response of riparian invasive species to environmental change requires not only an understanding of the role of climate in plant demography but also the impact of changes in hydrology on rates of spread.",

Moreover, periodic disturbances resulting from destructive flooding generally destroy or damage a large part of riparian vegetation (Ellenberg, 1988) thus creating openings that provide suitable habitats and favourable nutrient conditions for seedling establishment and subsequent colonization (Walker, Zasada & Chapin, 1986). Consequently, riparian habitats into which an alien species was successfully introduced and naturalized may serve as foci for subsequent spread into the adjacent landscape (Pyšek, 1991, 1993).",

Location Northwestern Switzerland. Methods We quantified the amount of illegally dumped garden waste at 20 sites over 1 yr and compared the soil conditions, species richness and abundance of plants in the ground vegetation at disposal sites with those at 20 control sites in urban deciduous forests. Results We found that illegal garden waste dumping frequently occurs in urban forests. At single sites, 0.1–12.5 m3 (mean: 2.6 m3) garden waste was dumped per month, resulting in a total annual amount of 2.2–35.8 m3 (mean: 17.8 m3) waste deposited. Thirty-seven of the 163 plant species recorded were not native to Switzerland. All 37 non-native species were recorded in waste disposal sites, but only three of them in control sites. Thus, garden waste dumping sites harboured a larger number of non-native species than control sites, but the two groups of sites did not differ in number of native species. The species composition also differed between disposal and control sites: larger proportions of species typical of disturbed habitats, more therophytes and species with autochorous seed dispersal were recorded in disposal sites than in control sites. Conclusions We provide evidence that numerous non-native horticultural plant species escape from dumping sites and colonize forests. There is an urgent need to increase awareness of garden owners concerning problems associated with illegal garden waste dumping.",

            "abstractNote": "Aquarium release is a vector for introducing nonnative species that threatens the ecological integrity of aquatic systems. Following coastal invasions by released aquarium strains of Caulerpa taxifolia, aquarists began using the macroalgal genus Chaetomorpha. Use of Chaetomorpha now exceeds 50% of U.S. aquarium hobbyists we surveyed. Aquarium strains of this macroalgal genus possess broad environmental tolerances, demonstrate high nutrient uptake and growth rates, and reproduce by fragmentation. Although these characteristics make Chaetomorpha a desirable aquarium inhabitant, they may also promote invasive tendencies if the alga is introduced into a natural ecosystem. We sought to proactively mitigate this potential invasion risk by testing algal disposal techniques that serve as responsible alternatives to releasing viable individuals. We tested methods used by aquarium hobbyists—boiling, microwaving, freezing, desiccation, and exposure to freshwater. We determined the minimum durations that these techniques must be used in order to induce mortality in three aquarium purchases of Chaetomorpha. We found that boiling for at least 1 min, microwaving for at least 15 s, or freezing for at least 24 h were sufficient to induce 100% mortality in 1-cm-long fragments and clumps up to 1.5 g. Desiccation required more than 24 h when exposed to air and 6 d for samples kept in closed containers. Freshwater exposure was effective at 6 d. These results indicate that disposal of excess or unwanted Chaetomorpha via garbage (if destined for a landfill) or indoor plumbing (e.g., sinks and toilets) represent safe alternatives to release. Disposal of algal tissue, shipping water, or tank water containing small algal fragments down stormwater drains, however, could introduce this hardy species into favorable conditions that could result in detrimental biological invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive nypa palms (Nypa fruticans) are a major threat to mangroves and coastal systems in the Niger Delta region in Nigeria, apart from oil and gas exploration. The palms were first introduced as foreign species to curb coastal erosion over a century ago (i.e. 1906). They later became invasive and started multiplying in the last 30 years. The palms have acclimatized to the coastal environment by developing superior root system, which they use to tap available nutrients. They also have tough and buoyant seeds, which aid in their wide dispersal. These qualities of the palms had made them to have an edge over the mangroves. Oil and gas exploration, which is responsible for numerous oil spillages, is a major cause of mangrove decimation. The establishment of open waste disposal sites in coastal areas have also contributed to the changes in soil and water qualities, leading to further decline in mangroves, with a resultant increase in invasive nypa palms. The palms change the pedology, hydrology and landscape architecture of the coastal environment once they are established. Therefore, a threat to the mangroves is a threat to the entire coastal system, which benefits from the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves. Mangroves may disappear completely from the Niger Delta in the next 50 years if the encroachment of the palms continue unabated. However, this problem can be resolved by the removal of the palms through mechanical, physical or chemical means. Soils on which the palms grow can be excavated to remove the allelopathic properties, after which the palm soil should be replaced with mangrove soil. To ensure smooth re-colonization of the coast, mangroves propagules with good genetic quality should be selected, nurtured and transplanted from the nursery to the coastal areas. The mangrove propagules should be monitored and protected from further invasion by nypa palm after planting.",

            "abstractNote": "This paper compares the rate of invasion of Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae), a Caucasian species invading Europe, at three spatial scales (continental, regional, and local). The rate of invasion was evaluated using inclusion curves, by plotting the cumulative number of invaded countries against time on the continental scale of Europe, number of occupied grid cells at the regional scale of the Czech Republic, and invaded area inferred from a series of aerial photographs taken at the local scale over a period of 49 years in the Slavkovký les region, Czech Republic. Time of 50% inclusion (with 95% confidence intervals, CI) of invaded countries, occupied grid cells, and invaded area was assessed. The invasion was slowest at the continental scale (62 years, CI = 53–70) and did not differ significantly between regional (16 years, CI = 10–20) and local (22 years, CI = 19–24) scales. Our results indicate that there are two different mechanisms of spread acting together in this system, namely human influences and natural spread, and the relative influence of these mechanisms appears to change in an inverse proportion from the largest to the smallest scale. At the local scale, under suitable habitat conditions, the process is driven by biological traits of the species related to dispersal. At the continental and regional scales, humans played a crucial role in the invasion of H. mantegazzianum by planting it as a garden ornamental. At these scales, human-mediated dispersal seems to have been the major driver of spread, responsible for creating dispersal foci in the initial phases of invasion. Species traits played an important role in local spread, resulting in the colonization of new sites.",

The most numerous were fragments of fishing gear (buoys, ropes, nets) followed by various containers, sheets of foil and plastic textiles. The total density was estimated at 14 400 items with a total weight of 18 tonnes of plastic debris on the inspected coastline. The largest objects (fishing boxes, containers) were colonised by barnacles (Semibalanus sp.), gooseneck barnacles (Lepas sp.), blue shells (Mytilus sp.), bryozoans and marine macro-algae. The rafting of groups of adult organisms favours their better biological dispersal compared to larval transport, and is regarded here as the main reason for reappearance of genus Mytilus on Svalbard.",

            "abstractNote": "Using a representative set of 10 of the worst invasive species in Europe, this study investigates the relative importance of climatic, habitat and socio-economic factors in driving the occurrence of invasive species. According to the regression models performed, these factors can be interpreted as multi-scale filters that determine the occurrence of invasive species, with human degradation potentially affecting the performance of the other two environmental filters. Amongst climate factors, minimum temperature of the coldest month was one of the most important drivers of the occurrence of Europe’s worst freshwater and terrestrial invaders like the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), Bermuda buttercup (Oxalis pes-caprae) and Sika deer (Cervus nippon). Water chemistry (alkalinity, pH, nitrate) determines the availability of habitat and resources for species at regional to local levels and was relevant to explain the occurrence of aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders such as the brook trout (Salvalinus fontinallis) and Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Likewise, nitrate and cholorophyll-a concentration were important determinants of marine invaders like the bay barnacle (Balanus improvisus) and green sea fingers (Codium fragile). Most relevant socio-economic predictors included the density of roads, country gross domestic product (GDP), distance to ports and the degree of human influence on ecosystems. These variables were particularly relevant to explain the occurrence of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and coypu (Myocastor coypu), species usually associated to disturbed environments. The Japanese kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) was generally distributed much closer to ports than the other two marine organisms, although insufficient information on human impacts prevented a correct assessment of the three marine species. In conclusion, this study shows how socio-economic development is associated with the presence of the top 10 worst European invasive species at a continental scale, and relates this fact to the provision and transport of propagules and the degradation of natural habitats that favour the establishment of invasive species.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract Aim On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that resulted in the largest known rafting event in recorded history. By spring 2012, marine debris began washing ashore along the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada with a wide range of Asian coastal species attached. We used this unique dataset, where the source region, date of dislodgment and landing location are known, to assess the potential for species invasions by transoceanic rafting on marine debris. Location Northeast Pacific from 20 to 60°N. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Forty-eight invertebrate and algal species recorded on Japanese tsunami marine debris (JTMD). Methods We developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models for 48 species recorded on JTMD to predict establishment potential along the Pacific coast from 20 to 60°N. Models were compared within the context of historical marine introductions from Japan to this region to validate the emergence of marine debris as a novel vector for species transfer. Results Overall, 27% (13 species) landed with debris at locations with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, indicating that these species may be able to establish new populations or introduce greater genetic diversity to already established non-native populations. A further 21 species have an environmental match to areas where tsunami debris likely landed, but was not extensively sampled. Nearly 100 Japanese marine species previously invaded the northeastern Pacific, demonstrating this region’s environmental suitability for rafting Japanese biota. Historical invasions from Japan are highest in California and largely known from bays and harbours. Main conclusions Marine debris is a novel and growing vector for non-native species introduction. By utilizing a unique dataset of JTMD species, our predictive models show capacity for new transoceanic invasions and can focus monitoring priorities to detect successful long-distance dispersal across the world’s oceans.",

However, comparative studies using small mammal functional groups within rehabilitated mining sites are missing, despite their significant ecological contributions.ObjectivesWe investigated the recovery of small mammals according to their trophic guild and terrestriality in restored mining sites and analyzed whether they were influenced by restoration scheme (active or passive), restoration time, mineral type, body mass and invasive species. We were especially interested in whether functional groups showed different recovery patterns across time.MethodsWe classified small mammals into functional groups according to trophic levels distinguishing carnivores, herbivores and omnivores, and according to their terrestriality categorized as above ground-dwelling (AGD) and fossorial and/or ground-dwelling individuals (FGD). We studied small mammal recovery globally following restoration of mining sites based on a meta-analysis using effect sizes. Influences of environmental variables were investigated with linear mixed models using effect sizes as response variable.ResultsWe did not find significant differences for restoration scheme and time but we did for mineral type, body mass and invasive species in terms of population (abundance) recovery. Trajectories of functional group recoveries differed: FGD and herbivores quickly recovered after mining activities stopped, but declined later, whereas AGD, carnivores and omnivores recovered within the first few years or decades.ConclusionsOur results highlight the different vulnerability of functional groups, and the importance of considering this in conservation interventions.",

Surface coal mines in the Appalachian Mountains are among the most disturbed landscapes in North America, but information about land cover characteristics of Appalachian mined lands is lacking. The invasive shrub autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) occurs on these sites and interferes with ecosystem recovery by outcompeting native trees, thus inhibiting re-establishment of the native woody-plant community. We analyzed Landsat 8 satellite imagery to describe autumn olive’s distribution on post-mined lands in southwestern Virginia within the Appalachian coalfield. Eight images from April 2013 through January 2015 served as input data. Calibration and validation data obtained from high-resolution aerial imagery were used to develop a land cover classification model that identified areas where autumn olive was a primary component of land cover. Results indicate that autumn olive cover was sufficiently dense to enable detection on approximately 12.6 % of post-mined lands within the study area. The classified map had user’s and producer’s accuracies of 85.3 and 78.6 %, respectively, for the autumn olive coverage class. Overall accuracy was assessed in reference to an independent validation dataset at 96.8 %. Autumn olive was detected more frequently on mines disturbed prior to 2003, the last year of known plantings, than on lands disturbed by more recent mining. These results indicate that autumn olive growing on reclaimed coal mines in Virginia and elsewhere in eastern USA can be mapped using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager imagery; and that autumn olive occurrence is a significant landscape vegetation feature on former surface coal mines in the southwestern Virginia segment of the Appalachian coalfield.",

            "abstractNote": "The round goby Neogobius melanostomus is one of the most wide-ranging invasive fish on earth, with substantial introduced populations within the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed, the Baltic Sea and several major European rivers. Rapid expansion and deleterious ecosystem effects have motivated extensive research on this species; here this research is synthesized. Maps of the global distribution are provided and the invasion history of N. melanostomus, which spread more rapidly at first in North America, but has undergone substantial expansion over the past decade in the Baltic Sea, is summarized. Meta-analyses comparing their size at age, diet, competitors and predators in North American and European ecosystems are provided. Size at age is region specific, with saline habitats typically supporting larger and faster growing individuals than fresh water. Neogobius melanostomus prey differs substantially between regions, demonstrating a capacity to adapt to locally abundant food sources. Neogobius melanostomus comprise at least 50% of the diet of eight taxa in at least one site or life stage; in total, 16 predator taxa are documented from the Laurentian Great Lakes v. five from Eurasia. Invasive N. melanostomus are the only common forage fish to heavily exploit mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, facilitating the transfer of energy from mussels to higher trophic levels in both systems. Neogobius melanostomus morphology, life history, reproduction, habitat preferences, environmental tolerances, parasites, environmental effects, sampling strategies and management are also discussed. Neogobius melanostomus inhabit a wide range of temperate freshwater and brackish-water ecosystems and will probably continue to spread via ballast water, accidental bait release and natural dispersal worldwide. Climate change will probably enhance N. melanostomus expansion by elevating water temperatures closer to its energetic optimum of 26 degrees C. Future research needs are presented; most pressing are evaluating the economic effects of N. melanostomus invasion, determining long-term population level effects of egg predation on game-fish recruitment and comparing several variables (density, ecological effects morphology and life history) among invaded ecosystems. This review provides a central reference as researchers continue studying N. melanostomus, often as examples for advancing basic ecology and invasion biology.",

The effect of marine debris on wildlife, tourism and human health is well documented and there is considerable scientific literature about plastic litter in the sea and over the seabed, mostly highlighting the possible impact on marine mammals and tourism. Dispersal of marine and terrestrial organisms on floating objects has biogeographical and ecological interest. For some species, extension of their geographical range is more likely to be related to transport of mature individuals on floating rafts than to the active or passive dispersal of reproductive propagules. Variability and variety of rafting materials has increased dramatically in recent years and marine litter has been used widely as a raft by `hitch-hiking' species. This paper reports on the benthic invertebrates living on marine debris transported by wind and surface currents over the western Mediterranean Sea. Plastics accounted for the major item of debris because of poor degradability, however glass, cans, fishing nets and polyurethane containers, were also found. Macro-benthos living on raft material comprised mainly molluscs, polychaetes and bryozoans. Large fish were found commonly below large plastic bags. Estimations of the distances that may be covered by hitch-hiking species and the contribution of rafting to the theoretical dispersal of species is provided.",

A total of 387 taxa, including pro-and eukaryotic microorganisms, seaweeds and invertebrates, have been found rafting on floating litter in all major oceanic regions. Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crustaceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Micro-organisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although the composition of the microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum characteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organisms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters themselves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world's oceans, rafting dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species.",

We conducted a greenhouse experiment to test this hypothesis by using invasive Solidago canadensis and native Kummerowia striata as model plant species under lead contamination. Lead was applied as Pb(AC)(2).3H(2)O in solution at three levels (0, 300 mg kg(-1) and 600 mg kg(-1) soil) to simulate control and two pollution sites on which S. canadensis was found. Invasive Solidago canadensis, native Kummerowia striata, and their combination were grown Linder each Pb treatment. Under monoculture no differences of biomass, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) contents in S. canadensis were found among treatments, but the growth of native K. striata was significantly depressed at higher soil Pb concentration. When both species were mixed, elevated soil Pb concentrations significantly increased shoot biomass ratio of S. canadensis to K. striata, implying that Pb enhanced the competition of S. canadensis over K. striata. Compared to monoculture, biomass and N and P contents of S. canadensis significantly increased under mixture with K. striata in each Pb treatment. Under both monoculture and mixed culture, Pb concentrations in shoots, roots, and rhizomes of S. canadensis increased with soil Pb content, but Pb concentrations in both above- and below-ground tissues of S. canadensis were significantly lower in Mixture than that in monoculture under each Pb treatment. Both Pb treatments and mixture with native K. striata did not change biomass allocation to shoot, root and rhizome of S. canadensis. Evidence from our experiment supported the hypothesis that higher tolerance to Pb stress enabled the invasive S. canadensis to outperform the native K. striata and may have promoted its rapid invasion in Pb contaminated soil.",

However, few studies have investigated the impact of environmental contamination on competitive behavior in ants as a potential factor influencing dynamics between invasive and native ant species. Here we investigated the widespread contaminant selenium to investigate its potential influence on invasion by the exotic Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, through effects on reproduction and competitive behavior. For the fecundity experiment, treatments were provided to Argentine ant colonies via to sugar water solutions containing one of three concentrations of selenium (0, 5 and 10 mu g Se mL(-1)) that fall within the range found in soil and plants growing in contaminated areas. Competition experiments included both the Argentine ant and the native Dorymyrmex bicolor to determine the impact of selenium exposure (0 or 15 mu g Se mL(-1)) on exploitation- and interference-competition between ant species. The results of the fecundity experiment revealed that selenium negatively impacted queen survival and brood production of Argentine ants. Viability of the developing brood was also affected in that offspring reached adulthood only in colonies that were not given selenium, whereas those in treated colonies died in their larval stages. Selenium exposure did not alter direct competitive behaviors for either species, but selenium exposure contributed to an increased bait discovery time for D. bicolor. Our results suggest that environmental toxins may not only pose problems for native ant species, but may also serve as a potential obstacle for establishment among exotic species.

            "abstractNote": "A virtually intact subtropical reef community (14 phyla, 40 families and 62 non-native taxa) was associated with a rig under tow from Brazil that became stranded on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha. This exposes rigs as a significant vector spreading alien marine organisms, and includes the first records of free-swimming marine finfish populations becoming established after unintentional movement. With relatively trivial effort, a pre-tow clean would have obviated the need to salvage and dispose of the rig (undertaken largely to address concerns about invasive species), at a cost of ~US$20 million. Our findings show that towing biofouled structures across biogeographic boundaries present unexcelled opportunities for invasion to a wide diversity of marine species. Better control and management of this vector is required urgently. Simultaneous, unintentional introductions of viable populations of multiple marine organisms are rare events, and we develop a basic framework for rapid assessment of invasion risks.",

Unfortunately, to date, the study of invasions has been primarily anecdotal and resistant to generalization. 2 Here, we use insights from experiments and from long-term monitoring studies of vegetation to propose a new theory in which fluctuation in resource availability is identified as the key factor controlling invasibility, the susceptibility of an environment to invasion by non-resident species. The theory is mechanistic and quantitative in nature leading to a variety of testable predictions. 3 We conclude that the elusive nature of the invasion process arises from the fact that it depends upon conditions of resource enrichment or release that have a variety of causes but which occur only intermittently and, to result in invasion, must coincide with availability of invading propagules.",

However, in the past decade, a rapid increase in studies of coastal invasions has provided important insight into the invasion process in these systems and how these invasions might differ qualitatively from invasions elsewhere. Based on new evidence for cryptic species invasions, hybridization among invaders and native species, impacts on multiple species and ecosystems, and the rapid and extensive geographical spread of invaders, it is clear that the ecological and evolutionary consequences of invasions in heavily invaded coastal habitats might be more extensive than previously realized. Although these studies have produced important new advances, many other areas remain relatively unexplored and are ripe for future investigation.",

            "abstractNote": "Earth's biodiversity and carbon uptake by plants, or primary productivity, are intricately interlinked, underlie many essential ecosystem processes, and depend on the interplay among environmental factors, many of which are being changed by human activities. While ecological theory generalizes across taxa and environments, most empirical tests of factors controlling diversity and productivity have been observational, single-site experiments, or meta-analyses, limiting our understanding of variation among site-level responses and tests of general mechanisms. A synthesis of results from ten years of a globally distributed, coordinated experiment, the Nutrient Network (NutNet), demonstrates that species diversity promotes ecosystem productivity and stability, and that nutrient supply and herbivory control diversity via changes in composition, including invasions of non-native species and extinction of native species. Distributed experimental networks are a powerful tool for tests and integration of multiple theories and for generating multivariate predictions about the effects of global changes on future ecosystems.",
