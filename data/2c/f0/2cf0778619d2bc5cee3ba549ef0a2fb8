However, the focus on terminology tends to obscure complex differences in meanings and cultural perception. Examining a case study in the Chilcotin region of British Columbia, we explore how the terms “wild” and “feral” distract from the underlying issues at stake in management of horses and the landscape: different ways of valuing, understanding, and relating to land and animals. To be effective in the long term, and to avoid an unwitting continuation of outdated culturally biased land management practices, future decisions regarding management of lands and free-roaming horses in the Chilcotin would benefit from an integrated process informed by both ecological and socio-cultural information.",

Since then, this species has spread widely through the southern United States and by 1985 had infested over 9.3 million km 2. Attempts to control fire ants with Mirex were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency of the US Department of the Interior. The importance of RIFA control in the ecosystem is controversial because some people are allergic to the stings, and it is reported that the effects on some plants and animals can be either beneficial or harmful. It has been reported that in some cases, economic damage was inflicted on some agronomic crops. Ground-nesting birds, lizards and other wildlife are preyed upon by R1FA. However, there is evidence for beneficial aspects of RIFA as a pest control agent and this includes predacious activities on ticks, horn flies (Haematobia irritans), and different agricultural pests. These activities impact on various zoonotic vector-borne diseases, such as tularemia and Lyme disease. However, anyone considering importing RIFA to control ticks should be aware that survival of the ant is limited to suitable climatic and ecological conditions and that the ant has never been controlled satisfactorily or eradicated once established in a suitable habitat.",

I present a novel methodological approach to assess the importance boaters placed on 16 water issues in a lake-rich region of northern Wisconsin. A latent class maximum difference conjoint model was used to examine the relationships between environmental concern and engagement with lake resources. Boaters were grouped to maximize observed heterogeneity in prioritizing issues of concern. Sociodemographic characteristics, recreation specialization, place attachment, and attitudes concerning aquatic stewardship and invasive species management were then used to predict class membership. This modeling approach identiﬁed ﬁve groups whose perceptions of issues pertaining to lakes are inﬂuenced by their interactions with the lake environment. While anglers were most concerned about ﬁshing quality, sightseers identiﬁed lakeshore development and loss of natural habitat. Groups also differed in their socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics. The priorities of each group were substantially different from those of the overall sample. Accounting for differences in stakeholders’ environmental concerns may improve public involvement in water management initiatives by allowing managers to identify common concerns and prioritize important issues among multiple groups.",

Preliminary socio-economic data and analysis reveal that the tribe’s vulnerability to climate change is related to cultural and economic dependence on Pyramid Lake, while external socio-economic vulnerability factors influence adaptive capacity and amplify potential impacts. Reduced water supplies as a consequence of climate change would result in a compounded reduction of inflows to Pyramid Lake, thus potentially impacting the spawning and sustenance of a cultural livelihood, the endangered cui-ui fish (Chasmistes cujus). Meanwhile, limited economic opportunities and dwindling federal support constrain tribal adaptive capacity. Factors that contribute to tribal adaptive capacity include: sustainability-based values, technical capacity for natural resource management, proactive initiatives for the control of invasive-species, strong external scientific networks, and remarkable tribal awareness of climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "In 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture requested assistance from the American Malacological Society in the development of a list of non-native snails and slugs of top national quarantine signiﬁcance. From a review of the major pest snail and slug literature, together with our own experience, we developed a preliminary list of gastropod species displaying signiﬁcant potential to damage natural ecosystems or agriculture, or human health or commerce, and either entirely absent from the United States to our knowledge or restricted to narrow areas of introduction. Comments on the list from the worldwide malacological community were then solicited and led us to modify the original list. We then evaluated the taxa on this list by ranking them according to 12 attributes—seven biological variables and ﬁve aspects of human interaction—based on thorough review of the detailed literature. The ranked list that emerged from this risk assessment process included 46 taxa (species or species-groups) in 18 families. The highest ranked taxa were in the Ampullariidae, Hygromiidae, Cochlicellidae, Helicidae, Veronicellidae, Succineidae, Achatinidae, and Planorbidae. We validated the risk assessment model by scoring a suite of non-native snail and slug species already present in the United States. The list is not deﬁnitive but rather is offered as a framework for additional research. There remain important gaps in biological knowledge of many of the taxa evaluated, and rigorous reporting of economic impacts is extremely limited. We expect the prioritizing and listing of taxa to be dynamic, not only as these knowledge gaps are ﬁlled but also as environmental, agricultural, international trade, and societal factors change.",

Although several studies have estimated the effect of FAW on maize yield, little is known about its impact on broader welfare outcomes. Using data from smallholder maize-­growing households in Zimbabwe, this article aimed to measure the impact of FAW on household income and food security, as well as the extent to which the adoption of a control strategy can help mitigate the negative welfare impacts due to FAW invasion. Regression results showed that households affected by FAW were 12% more likely to experience hunger, as measured by the household hunger scale. A disaggregated analysis indicated that minor FAW infestation did not exert significant impacts on incomes and food security, but severe level of infestation reduced per capita household income by 44% and increased a household's likelihood of experiencing hunger by 17%. We also found that compared to unaffected households, the FAW-­ affected households who failed to implement a control strategy had a 50% lower per capita household income, while their counterparts that implemented a control strategy did not suffer a significant income loss. These findings point to the need to promote strategies to prevent high infestation levels of FAW so as to mitigate its detrimental welfare effects.",

Regarding alien species relevant for human health, climate change can modify their impacts by altering the likelihood of their introduction, establishment, distribution and abundance, the scale of impacts and management. In this chapter, we summarize climate change impacts on health-relevant alien species with a focus on Europe. Climate change can support introductions of alien species impacting human health, but its role is moderate compared with the other aspects of globalization, such as increased trade and people’s increased mobility. There is strong evidence that changing climate characteristics, notably temperature, are crucial for the establishment and spread of human health-relevant alien species. Resulting increases and shifts in distribution might cause increasing health impacts, particularly in cold regions such as temperate and polar regions or areas of higher elevation. In Europe, changes in health impacts caused by alien species are mainly related to arthropod vectors and plants with allergenic pollen. As numbers of alien species will probably increase, preventive management need to be strengthened. Further, a better understanding of drivers and management options of alien diseases and vectors, as well as joint efforts in education and outreach to the public and decision-makers, is required. There is a need for action and research, ­particularly in the fields of pathway management, epidemiology, modelling and vector monitoring.",

We report a cluster of eosinophilic meningitis presumably attributable to A. cantonensis among French policemen returning from French Polynesia.MethodsA retrospective cohort study among French policemen who had stayed in Tahiti was conducted using a clinical definition of eosinophilic meningitis that included severe headache within 30 days after return and eosinophilia, and who consumed locally exotic ethnic dishes with uncooked freshwater prawns.ResultsFive persons met the case definition for eosinophilic meningitis. Corticosteroid therapy associated with antihelminthic regimen led to improvement of symptoms in one patient. Other patients were treated with albendazole alone. All patients recovered.ConclusionAmong travellers at risk, the presence of severe headache and eosinophilia combined with a consistent exposure history to exotic food should alert to the possibility of A. cantonensis infestation. Travellers should be aware of the risk of infection associated with eating exotic ethnic dishes.",

This review will also enhance the reader's knowledge of the available diagnostic methods and therapeutic measures, including the role of fire ant venom versus whole body extract in the management of fire ant allergy.\nData sources\nInformation for this review was obtained primarily from abstracts and articles written by investigators recognized for their expertise in fire ant venom research.\nStudy selection\nReferences were selected based on their clinical applicability and relevance to the epidemiology and pathophysiology of imported fire ant hypersensitivity.\nConclusions\nThe imported fire ant represents a significant health hazard for persons living in fire ant endemic areas in the southern United States. Sting reactions range from local pustules and large, late-phase responses to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Fire ant allergen-specific immunotherapy can reduce the risk of subsequent systemic reactions. Four important Sol i venom allergens have been isolated and characterized. Clinical studies have been designed to compare the safety and efficacy of fire ant venom with whole body extract for diagnosis and treatment of fire ant allergy.",

We report the case of an adult who ingested a raw, giant African snail (Achatina fulica) on the island of O‘ahu in Hawai‘i and developed an eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with severe headache, confusion, sixth cranial nerve palsy, ataxia, limb weakness, and paresthesia. He was treated with lumbar punctures to relieve pressure, high dose corticosteroids, and 14 days of albendazole. He had a prolonged convalescence, requiring 3 months of prednisone, and still had evidence of motor nerve weakness 4 months after exposure. A field investigation at the site of exposure yielded 5 of 9 Achatina fulica snails with evidence of A. cantonensis DNA by PCR. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from the patient were negative acutely but positive on day 15 of symptoms, using an investigational, real-time PCR assay. We discuss clinical management of this case in light of the current medical literature.",

Thirteen outbreak reports were based on clinical observations alone, and 11 confirmed by serological/virological methods. Detailed epidemiological profiles of two investigated outbreaks in Bogor and Bekasi are presented. Human sera were screened using an ELISA for IgM and IgG anti-CHIK antibodies. Additionally, reverse transcriptase PCR and virus isolation were attempted for virus identification. The mean age of cases was 37 ± 18 years in Bogor and 33 ± 20 years in Bekasi. There was no outstanding case-clustering, although outbreak-affected households were observed to be geographically grouped within villages. The attack rates in Bogor and Bekasi were 2.8/1000 and 6.7/1000 inhabitants respectively. Both outbreaks started in the rainy season following increased Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus densities.",

            "abstractNote": "Emerging vector-borne diseases represent an important issue for global health. Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, and many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and local emergence are frequently considered distinct processes, many emerging endemic pathogens are in fact invading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We highlight key differences in the dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission following habitat change compared with the introduction of pathogens to new regions. Truly in situ emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel and suitable conditions for a pathogen, including hosts, vectors, and climate. Once established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics shape the evolutionary selective pressure on pathogens that may result in increased use of humans as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that may be more effective in the long term.",

The extensive use of synthetic insecticides in the mosquito control strategies resulted to the development of pesticide resistance and fostered environmental deterioration. Hence in recent years plants become alternative source of mosquito control agents. The present study assessed the larvicidal activity of Prosopis juliflora, a dominant invasive weed in wastelands of Madhya Pradesh region, India. Leaf extracts in methanol was used in the range of 10-200 ppm in the laboratory bioassays against third instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. The mortality data were recorded after 24 hrs and subjected to probit analysis to determine the lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90). Amongst all mosquito species An. subpictus larvae showed highest mortality with LC50 39.19 ppm and LC90 175.24 ppm followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus with the LC50 and LC90 values 59.37 and 243.20 ppm respectively. In case of Ae. aegypti, less mortality was observed in larvae as compared to the other mosquitoes with LC50126.79 and LC90 457.32 ppm. The results indicate that P. juliflora leaf methanol extract have the potential to be used as an ecofriendly approach for the control of An. subpictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Further studies on the screening, isolation and purification of bioactive phytochemical constituents/compounds followed by in-depth laboratory and field bioassays are needed.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Allergenicity to Prosopis juliflora pollen antigen has been reported from only a few countries, including the US, South Africa, India and Kuwait. In some parts of Saudi Arabia, species of Prosopis have been introduced by the millions as roadside ornamentation. There appear to be four flowering seasons during which pollen grains float in all directions. However, the role of Prosopis pollen as the sensitizing and/or triggering agent of allergic asthma and/or rhinitis in the Kingdom has never been evaluated. Patients and Methods: A total of 473 allergic patients suffering from bronchial asthma in four different geographical regions (Abha, Qassim, Hofuf and Gizan), and attending allergy clinics and chest disease centers of university and Ministry of Health hospitals in the region were tested for immediate hypersensitivity reaction to Prosopis juliflora allergens. Airborne pollen grains at one center were also studied for one full year, using volumetric sampling techniques.\nResults: A total of 76.1% patients in Qassim, 37.5% in Gizan, 29% in Abha and 11% in Hofuf reacted positively to Prosopis antigen. Multiple sensitivities to other pollen antigens were detected in all patients. The level of airborne Prosopis pollen detected in Gizan exceeded 90 grains m-3 of air.\nConclusion: In view of the documented evidence of Prosopis-involved allergenicity, the role of Prosopis pollen as a sensitizing factor in Saudi Arabia has been confirmed. However, the cause of elicitation of symptoms in many multiple sensitive patients, together with the question of cross-reactivities, needs thorough and detailed investigation. In vitro confirmation of all positive results is also required to incriminate Prosopis as one of the major allergens in parts of Saudi Arabia.",

This study investigated the sensitizing allergens in Kuwaiti patients with extrinsic asthma.MethodsA total of 553 asthmatics (male:female ratio: 1.4; mean age: 31.7 years [range 3-76 years]) and 112 matched controls were studied. Sera from all patients/subjects were tested by the CAP-RAST method for specific IgE to 14 locally relevant inhalant allergens.ResultsSpecific IgE to at least one allergen was detected in 87.2% of the patients compared with 24.1% of controls. Among the confirmed extrinsic asthmatics, the sensitization rates for the allergen groups were as follows: pollens (87.1%), house dust (76.1%), and molds (30.3%). The three most prevalent sensitizing pollens were from Chenopodium (70.7%), Bermuda grass (62.9%), and Prosopis (62.7%), all of which are horticultural plants imported for the purpose of \"greening\" the desert. For all allergens, except the molds, the prevalence rate was higher in males than females, but age had only a weak effect. Severe asthma occurred significantly more frequently among mold-sensitized patients.ConclusionsThese results show that even in a desert environment, pollens and house-dust allergens may be important sensitizing allergens. They also illustrate how practices that \"green\" the desert can affect public health.",

Allergy screenings for Ambrosia artemisiifolia have been included since 2004 and since 2006 screenings for the major allergen of ragweed and mugwort Amb a 1 and Art v 1 have been included as well. From 2004 to 2009 a total of 2.678 children and from 2008 to 2009 a total of 1.134 adults were tested. Approximately 37% of all children tested were sensitized against the inhalative allergen of the sx1 -Tests, about 15% were sensitized against the native Ambrosia artemisiifolia-allergen, about 3% were sensitized against the major allergen of Ambrosia (Amb a 1) and approximately 5% were sensitized against the native major allergen of mugwort (Art v 1).The sensitization rate of the adults tested was approximately the same as that of the children except for the sensitization against Amb a 1, where less than 1 % of the tested adults showed signs of sensitization. There wasa high cross reaction of the native Ambrosia artemisiifolia-allergen with the native mugwort-allergen as well as other allergens. However, the data on such positive sensitization does not necessarily involve a clinical relevance. Only a suitable differential diagnosis may give answers on the clinical importance. Even though from the current state of spread of Ambrosia no conclusion can be drawn on potential health risks, the further spreading of Ambrosia should be prevented in the terms of the precautionary principle and of the consideration of proportionality.",

In a globalized world, the emergence and spread of many human infectious pathogens are quintessential biological invasion events. Some macroscopic invasive species themselves contribute to the emergence and transmission of human infectious agents. We review conceptual parallels and differences between human epidemics and biological invasions by animals and plants. Fundamental concepts in invasion biology regarding the interplay of propagule pressure, species traits, biotic interactions, eco-evolutionary experience, and ecosystem disturbances can help to explain transitions between stages of epidemic spread. As a result, many forecasting and management tools used to address epidemics could be applied to biological invasions and vice versa. Therefore, we advocate for increasing cross-fertilization between the two disciplines to improve prediction, prevention, treatment, and mitigation of invasive species and infectious disease outbreaks, including pandemics.",

            "abstractNote": "Rangelands are Earth's dominant land cover and are important providers of ecosystem services. Reliance on rangelands is projected to grow, thus understanding the sensitivity of rangelands to future climates is essential. We used a new ecosystem model of moderate complexity that allows, for the first time, to quantify global changes expected in rangelands under future climates. The mean global annual net primary production (NPP) may decline by 10 g C m−2 year−1 in 2050 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, but herbaceous NPP is projected to increase slightly (i.e., average of 3 g C m−2 year−1). Responses vary substantially from place-to-place, with large increases in annual productivity projected in northern regions (e.g., a 21% increase in productivity in the US and Canada) and large declines in western Africa (−46% in sub-Saharan western Africa) and Australia (−17%). Soil organic carbon is projected to increase in Australia (9%), the Middle East (14%), and central Asia (16%) and decline in many African savannas (e.g., −18% in sub-Saharan western Africa). Livestock are projected to decline 7.5 to 9.6%, an economic loss of from $9.7 to $12.6 billion. Our results suggest that forage production in Africa is sensitive to changes in climate, which will have substantial impacts on the livelihoods of the more than 180 million people who raise livestock on those rangelands. Our approach and the simulation tool presented here offer considerable potential for forecasting future conditions, highlight regions of concern, and support analyses where costs and benefits of adaptations and policies may be quantified. Otherwise, the technical options and policy and enabling environment that are needed to facilitate widespread adaptation may be very difficult to elucidate.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions by nonindigenous species (NIS) can have adverse eﬀects on economically important goods and services, and sometimes result in an ‘invisible tax’ on natural resources (e.g. reduced yield). The combined economic costs of NIS may be signiﬁcant, with implications for environmental policy and resource management; yet economic impact assessments are rare at a national scale. Impacts of nuisance NIS may be direct (e.g. loss of hardwood trees) or indirect (e.g. alteration of ecosystem services provided by growing hardwoods). Moreover, costs associated with these eﬀects may be accrued to resources and services with clear ‘market’ values (e.g. crop production) and to those with more ambiguous, ‘non-market’ values (e.g. aesthetic value of intact forest). We characterised and projected economic costs associated with nuisance NIS in Canada, through a combination of case-studies and an empirical model derived from 21 identiﬁed eﬀects of 16 NIS. Despite a severe dearth of available data, characterised costs associated with ten NIS in Canadian ﬁsheries, agriculture and forestry totalled $187 million Canadian (CDN) per year. These costs were dwarfed by the ‘invisible tax’ projected for sixteen nuisance NIS found in Canada, which was estimated at between $13.3 and $34.5 billion CDN per year. Canada remains highly vulnerable to new nuisance NIS, but available manpower and ﬁnancial resources appear insuﬃcient to deal with this problem.",

Invasion of \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              caused significant shifts in plant species composition, which subsequently modified nematode assemblages. Stress-sensitive omnivores, fungivores and root-biomass-dependent obligate plant parasites best reflected changes in soil nematode communities under the influence of \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              invasion. The negative effect of \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              was most evident on \n              Aphelenchus \n              , \n              Tylencholaimus \n              , \n              Geocenamus \n              , \n              Helicotylenchus \n              , \n              Pratylenchus \n              , \n              Tylenchorhynchus \n              and \n              Aporcelaimellus \n              . Our results indicate that significant changes in the herbaceous layer after \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              invasion in ecosystems where \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              eventually became dominant impacted soil nematode communities but did not affect nematode diversity. This was in contrast to the habitats where a solitary plant of \n              H. sosnowskyi \n              grew and no significant changes in nematode communities were observed.",

Buffalo were introduced into Northern (Top End) Australia in the early nineteenth century. A team of transdisciplinary researchers, including an ethicist, has been engaged in field research on feral buffalo in Arnhem Land over the past three years. Using historical documents, literature review, field observations, interviews with key informants, and interaction with the Indigenous land owners, an understanding of the diverse views on the scientific, cultural, and economic significance of buffalo was obtained. While the diverse stakeholders in buffalo exploitation and management have historically delivered divergent value orientations on the nature of the human–buffalo relationship, we argue that over time there is the possibility of values and ethical convergence. Such convergence is possible via transdisciplinary and transcultural agreement on the value stances that constitute the construction of the being or identity of buffalo in the face of the overwhelming need to manage population density and gross numbers.",

On the other hand, a socio-economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the hookah (diving) system via face to face interviews. There were 207 vessels legally operating in the research area for whelk fisheries 108 of which were using the hookah system. Mean length and engine power of the hookah vessels were 8.8 m and 65 HP, respectively. It was also found that the average CPUE was 1050 kg/day and income rate was 79%, suggesting that whelk fishing had a high economic gain. Each of the hookah vessels provided an employment to average 3 individuals. According to the results, mean lengths of whelks harvested with dredges and hookah vessels were 5.61 cm and 5.83 cm, respectively. Length-weight relationship of the total production was determined as W=0.0223L2.965 (R2=0.85). It was concluded that the hookah system is more environmentally friendly method for the ecosystem than dredges.",

The inﬂuence of the MAE operational parameters (extraction time, temperature, solvent volume and stirring speed) on the physical and chemical proper- ties of agar (yield, gel strength, gelling and melting temperatures, as well as, sulphate and 3,6-anhydro-L- galactose contents) was evaluated in a 24 orthogonal composite design. The quality of the extracted agar compared favorably with the attained using traditional extraction (2 h at 85 °C) while reducing drasti- cally extraction time, solvent consumption and waste disposal requirements. Agar MAE optimum results were: an yield of 14.4 ± 0.4%, a gel strength of 1331 ± 51 g/cm2, 40.7 ± 0.2 °C gelling temperature, 93.1 ± 0.5 °C melting temperature, 1.73 ± 0.13% sulfate content and 39.4 ± 0.3% 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose content. Furthermore, this study suggests the feasibility of the exploitation of G. vermiculophylla grew in IMTA systems for agar production.",

However, environmental, socioeconomic and biodiversity issues are important considerations when regulating the unauthorized culture and spread of alien species. Information collected in the present review revealed the presence of over 300 alien species imported intentionally or illegally; 291 ornamental species, 31 aquaculture species and two larvicidal ﬁshes. Field data demonstrated the widespread occurrence of some of the world’s worst invasive species, for example, Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis niloticus, Aristichthys nobilis, Pygocentrus nattereri and Pterygoplichthys spp., in inland waters; other species are emerging as a threat to aquatic biodiversity. The beneﬁts and risks of alien species were analysed and the impact was quantiﬁed using a simple developed ‘Fish Invasiveness Screening Test’ (FIST). Our information suggests that alien species, despite possessing some attractive culture characteristics, generally reduce the availability of local species and establish in natural water bodies becoming invasive and consequently adversely affecting ﬁsh biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems. In light of the adverse ecological impacts of alien species, we developed strategic regulations and quarantine procedures and advised aquaculturists to strictly follow them to contain potential and plausible menaces.",

Reports by the first time Megalops atlanticus, commonly known as tarpon, from the Colombian Pacific Ocean, discussing its distribution, uses, and value for local human populations. Material and methods. Interviews with fishermen from the municipalities of Nuquí and Bahía Solano (Chocó Province) were carried upon in order to collect information about fishing points, ecologic characteristics, and uses of tarpon; samples were additionally taken in order to determine sex, gonadal maturity, and stomach contents. Results. Fifty interviews were made to fishermen who declared have fished tarpon at least once; fishing methods (hook and line, spear, and gill net) and main uses [consumption (65%), handcraft production (20%), commerce (7%) and game fishing (8%)] were got from them. Conclusions. Our study should be the base for additional research and management strategies for this species both in the Pacific and Caribbean Colombian coasts.",

This rapid loss of wetlands contrasts with the scarce information that exists about these ecosystems. To identify the environmental factors that control vegetation structure of a freshwater wetland invaded by the African grass Echinochloa pyramidalis , we characterized the vegetation (species composition, cover and aerial biomass), soil (moisture, redox potential, bulk density and topography) and water (water depth level, electric conductivity and pH) in two seasons of the year (dry and rainy). In addition, we analyzed the soil and water of three vegetation areas in the wetland, one dominated by E. pyramidalis , another by Sagittaria lancifolia and a third by Typha domingensis . The parameters associated with the hydrology of the wetland (water level, soil moisture, redox potential and bulk density) explained the plant species distribution. The invasive grass dominated in the relatively drier areas in the wetland while native species such as S. lancifolia , T. domingensis and Pontederia sagitatta dominated wetter sites. Introduction of E. pyramidalis has caused negative changes in the wetland, in particular a decrease of the diversity of plant species. In addition, we believe that the invader grass, as a C4 species, has more efficient use of water than the native plants, as well as a larger biomass, characteristics that can change the hydrological pattern of this wetland.",

The West Atlantic species was first noted off Damietta, on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, in 2012. This species has already been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea from the southeastern Levant to the Gulf of Lion, France. The impacts of the introduction of P. aztecus on the local biota, and in particular on the native and previously introduced penaeids, are as yet unknown. Shrimp farmers at the northern Nile Delta have been cultivating P. aztecus since 2016, depending on postlarvae and juveniles collected from the wild in the Damietta branch of the Nile estuary.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species can directly or indirectly alter (a)biotic characteristics of ecosystems, resulting in changing energy flows through the food web. This can potentially affect bottom-up or top-down control on resident species. The food web structure in the Biesbosch reservoirs (The Netherlands) was examined after recent invasions of the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), by means of stable isotope analysis. Quagga mussels reached relatively high densities after invasion, replacing the zebra mussel (D. polymorpha). The δ13C signatures in the food web showed two distinct basic signatures of primary producers: 1) phytoplankton and Elodea nuttallii, and 2) more enriched submerged macrophytes (i.e. Potamogeton sp.). Quagga mussel was found to rely on zooplankton and phytoplankton. Mussel detritus seemed to be of importance for the gammarid Dikerogammarus spp. (both D. villosus and D. haemobaphes). δ15N as a proxy for trophic level revealed that the largest specimens of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) formed the top of the food chain. A stable isotope mixing model estimated that 43% of round goby diet consisted of Dikerogammarus spp. and approximately 27% of quagga mussels. Ruffe diet consisted of 29% of quagga mussels and only 12% of Dikerogammarus sp. Quagga mussels were less important as a food source for round goby than often has been described. Besides being a food source, mussel beds also provide a suitable habitat for macroinvertebrates (i.e. Dikerogammarus spp.). The invasive round goby and native ruffe seemed to compete for food in the benthic zone, where round goby possibly forced ruffe to use less nutritive or favourable food sources. Likely, this has contributed to the decline in ruffe abundance after the invasion of the highly competitive round goby. The altered and recent new links between species have changed the food web. The successful invasion in the reservoirs by the benthic invaders — quagga mussel and round goby — changed the benthic-pelagic coupling and has most likely increased the importance of the benthic food web in these reservoirs.",

We established in total 30 plots in three natural habitats (forest, grassland, wetland) that were either uninvaded or mostly monospecifically invaded by F. japonica. The soil physical and microbial properties differed among the investigated plots, but the differences were observed to be non-significant between the invaded and the uninvaded plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling based on nematode species diversity indicated that the total number of identified nematode species and their abundance were higher in the uninvaded compare to the invaded plots. Negative effect of F. japonica on omnivores, plant parasites, and root-fungal feeder nematodes was confirmed by their lower abundance in the invaded compared to the uninvaded plots. In the invaded plots, we also confirmed lower Maturity and Channel index, but higher Enrichment index. Our results thus indicated that the invasive plant F. japonica could affect nematode communities, more than physical or microbial properties, regardless of habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Bioinvasion is a growing concern in aquatic ecosystems as it severely impacts biodiversity, causing ecosystem changes and heavy economic losses. The invasive bivalve mussel Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) is spreading in many estuarine ecosystems and brackishwater lakes in Kerala coast. Its rapid spread across the state might have been triggered by Ockhi, a strong tropical cylone in the Arabian sea that struck the Kerala coast in 2017. Furthermore, the frequent transport of fishing vessles from the inshore waters to the estuaries must have facilitated their spread. This study reveals that the rapidly increasing biomass of M. strigata in Ashtamudi Lake, a Ramsar site in Kerala, has wiped out the populations of green mussel (Perna viridis) and their massive settlement in many areas has replaced the dominant clam species (short-neck clam or yellow-foot clam, Marcia recens) and backwater oysters Magallana bilineata and Saccostrea cuccullata populations, which support the livelihoods of hundreds of fishers in the area, besides damaging the aquaculture systems. The increasing populations of M. strigata, coupled with its ability to survive across the salinity gradients from the mouth of the estuary to the river discharge zone in the tail end, may have long-term implications on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the lake.",

            "abstractNote": "Reliable estimates of the impacts and costs of biological invasions are critical to developing credible management, trade and regulatory policies. Worldwide, forests and urban trees provide important ecosystem services as well as economic and social benefits, but are threatened by non-native insects. More than 450 non-native forest insects are established in the United States but estimates of broad-scale economic impacts associated with these species are largely unavailable. We developed a novel modeling approach that maximizes the use of available data, accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty, and provides cost estimates for three major feeding guilds of non-native forest insects. For each guild, we calculated the economic damages for five cost categories and we estimated the probability of future introductions of damaging pests. We found that costs are largely borne by homeowners and municipal governments. Wood- and phloemboring insects are anticipated to cause the largest economic impacts by annually inducing nearly $1.7 billion in local government expenditures and approximately $830 million in lost residential property values. Given observations of new species, there is a 32% chance that another highly destructive borer species will invade the U.S. in the next 10 years. Our damage estimates provide a crucial but previously missing component of cost-benefit analyses to evaluate policies and management options intended to reduce species introductions. The modeling approach we developed is highly flexible and could be similarly employed to estimate damages in other countries or natural resource sectors.",

The successful occupation of North America (and most other continents as well) has earned the starling a nomination in the Top 100 list of ‘Worlds Worst’ invaders. Pimentel et al. (2000) estimated that starling damage to agriculture crops in the United States was $800 million yearly, based on $5/ha damage. Starlings may spread infectious diseases that sicken humans and livestock, costing nearly $800 million in health treatment costs. Lastly, starlings perhaps have contributed to the decline of native cavity-nesting birds by usurping their nesting sites. We describe the life history of starlings, their economic impact on agriculture, and their potential role as vectors in spreading diseases to livestock and humans. We recommend that the database on migratory and local movements of starlings be augmented and that improved baits and baiting strategies be developed to reduce nuisance populations.",

We reviewed 97 weed–crop competition experiments in 32 papers that included 30 alien weed and 14 crop species. The majority (68.92%) were randomised block designs where the alien weed had been either added (additive experiments) or removed (removal experiments). We propose using the relative competition index to estimate the effect of alien species in all systems, specifying in each case the density and proportion of alien and native plants essayed. We found that the impact of the weed cannot be considered independently of the crop and, thus, we should be cautious in ranking weed species according to their competition effect. A similar situation can be postulated for alien plants interfering with native species. Invaded communities are not random assemblages, and researchers tend to study the most competitive alien plants. We also found that the effect of the weed on crop yield depends on the duration of the interference and the life-history stage of the weed–crop system at which the interaction takes place. We were not able to conduct a more rigorous comparative analysis of the impacts, such as a meta-analysis. To do this would require some measure of the variation of the competition effect such as standard deviation or standard error, which we found are almost never reported.",

            "abstractNote": "Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) is a globally invasive neotropical rust of the Myrtaceae that came into international prominence following extensive damage to exotic Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2005, myrtle rust established in Hawaii (USA), and over the past 12 years has spread from the Americas into Asia, the Pacific, and South Africa. Myrtle rust was detected in Australia in 2010, and the response and ultimately unsuccessful eradication attempt was a lesson to those concerned about the threat of exotic pests and diseases to Australia's environment. Seven years following establishment, we are already observing the decline of many myrtaceous species and severe impacts to native plant communities. However, the recently developed Myrtle rust in Australia draft action plan identified that there is no nationally coordinated response strategy for the environmental dimensions of this threat. Recent reviews have identified a greater need for involvement from environmental agencies in biosecurity preparedness, response, and resourcing, and we believe this approach needs to extend to the management of invasive environmental pathogens once they establish.",

            "abstractNote": "Eucalyptus camaldulensis can be seen as an iconic tree of superlatives. It is the eucalypt with the widest native range, and one of the most widely planted eucalypts around the globe. In South Africa, it is the most widespread and the most aggressively invasive eucalypt. It has many uses, but also causes major impacts. However, little is known about key aspects of its ecology in South Africa, including its invasion history, invasion processes and dynamics, and people’s perceptions of its positive and negative effects on ecosystems. Such knowledge is crucial for developing robust and defendable guidelines for sustainable management of the species. This paper provides a comprehensive dossier of the species in South Africa. It reviews what is known of its introduction and planting history, its current distribution, its value for commercial forestry and other uses, its impacts as an invasive species, pests and pathogens associated with the species, people’s perceptions of the species and conflicts of interest, and the options for management and restoration. The review reveals that E. camaldulensis is a tree of many contradictions in South Africa, making it a poster-child example of a conflict-generating non-native species. Based on available knowledge, we assess options for improved management. We highlight several knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in more detail through future research. It is hoped that this species profile will serve as a model for the types of information that are needed for developing objective management strategies for non-native tree species in different parts of the world.",

In spite of the dramatic changes observed in the vegetation of invaded sites little is known about the consequences of invasion for soil microorganisms. To investigate the effect of A. dealbata invasion on the structure of soil fungi and bacteria communities, samples were taken from invaded and non-invaded areas from three different ecosystems in Northwest Spain: pine forest, shrubland and grassland. In each ecosystem type, soil samples were taken in areas of native vegetation, areas invaded by A. dealbata and in the transition zone between native and invaded vegetation. Soil microorganisms were analyzed in the different samples by PCR-DGGE using general primers for eubacteria and fungi. Soil analyses were also performed to evaluate the effect of A. dealbata invasion on soil fertility.",

            "abstractNote": "Non-native tree (NNT) species have been transported worldwide to create or enhance services that are fundamental for human well-being, such as timber provision, erosion control or ornamental value; yet NNTs can also produce undesired effects, such as fire proneness or pollen allergenicity. Despite the variety of effects that NNTs have on multiple ecosystem services, a global quantitative assessment of their costs and benefits is still lacking. Such information is critical for decision-making, management and sustainable exploitation of NNTs. We present here a global assessment of NNT effects on the three main categories of ecosystem services, including regulating (RES), provisioning (PES) and cultural services (CES), and on an ecosystem disservice (EDS), i.e. pollen allergenicity. By searching the scientific literature, country forestry reports, and social media, we compiled a global data set of 1683 case studies from over 125 NNT species, covering 44 countries, all continents but Antarctica, and seven biomes. Using different meta-analysis techniques, we found that, while NNTs increase most RES (e.g. climate regulation, soil erosion control, fertility and formation), they decrease PES (e.g. NNTs contribute less than native trees to global timber provision). Also, they have different effects on CES (e.g. increase aesthetic values but decrease scientific interest), and no effect on the EDS considered. NNT effects on each ecosystem (dis)service showed a strong context dependency, varying across NNT types, biomes and socio-economic conditions. For instance, some RES are increased more by NNTs able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and when the ecosystem is located in low-latitude biomes; some CES are increased more by NNTs in less-wealthy countries or in countries with higher gross domestic products. The effects of NNTs on several ecosystem (dis)services exhibited some synergies (e.g. among soil fertility, soil formation and climate regulation or between aesthetic values and pollen allergenicity), but also trade-offs (e.g. between fire regulation and soil erosion control). Our analyses provide a quantitative understanding of the complex synergies, trade-offs and context dependencies involved for the effects of NNTs that is essential for attaining a sustained provision of ecosystem services.",

To elucidate distribution of CyHV-3 in a wild common carp population, we conducted a PCR survey of CyHV-3 among such fish in Lake Biwa in 2006. Only 6% (1/18) of the common carp smaller than 300 mm were positive with PCR, whereas 31% (18/58) of fish larger than 300 mm were positive. To evaluate their past exposure to CyHV-3 infection based on the presence of antibodies, we also measured the levels of serum anti-CyHV-3 antibodies in the carp, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. None (0/26) of the fish smaller than 300 mm was positive for the antibodies, whereas 54% (33/61) of fish larger than 300 mm were positive. Of the antibody-positive individuals, 44% (14/32) were also positive by PCR strongly suggesting that wild common carp that survived infection become CyHV-3 carriers. Five individuals were positive by PCR but negative for antibodies indicating that their infection with CyHV-3 had occurred recently. These results suggest that transmission of CyHV-3 from carriers to naïve common carp is still occurring in Lake Biwa.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions are one of the top drivers of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. An underestimated consequence of invasions is the enormity of their economic impacts. Knowledge gaps regarding economic costs produced by invasive alien species (IAS) are pervasive, particularly for emerging economies such as India—the fastest growing economy worldwide. To investigate, highlight and bridge this gap, we synthesised data on the economic costs of IAS in India. Specifically, we examine how IAS costs are distributed spatially, environmentally, sectorally, taxonomically, temporally, and across introduction pathways; and discuss how Indian IAS costs vary with socioeconomic indicators. We found that IAS have cost the Indian economy between at least US$ 127.3 billion to 182.6 billion (Indian Rupees ₹ 8.3 trillion to 11.9 trillion) over 1960–2020, and these costs have increased with time. Despite these massive recorded costs, most were not assigned to specific regions, environments, sectors, cost types and causal IAS, and these knowledge gaps are more pronounced in India than in the rest of the world. When costs were specifically assigned, maximum costs were incurred in West, South and North India, by invasive alien insects in semi-aquatic ecosystems; they were incurred mainly by the public and social welfare sector, and were associated with damages and losses rather than management expenses. Our findings indicate that the reported economic costs grossly underestimate the actual costs, especially considering the expected costs given India’s population size, gross domestic product and high numbers of IAS without reported costs. This cost analysis improves our knowledge of the negative economic impacts of biological invasions in India and the burden they can represent for its development. We hope this study motivates policymakers to address socio-ecological issues in India and launch a national biological invasion research programme, especially since economic growth will be accompanied by greater impacts of global change.",

            "abstractNote": "Like most jurisdictions, Australia is managing a broad range of invasive alien species. Here, we provide the first holistic quantification of how much invasive species impact Australia’s economy, and how much Australia spends on their management. In the 01–02 financial year (June to July), the combined estimated cost (economic losses and control) of invasive species was $9.8 billion, rising to $13.6 billion in the 11–12 financial year. Approximately $726 million of grants funded through the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e. federal funding) was spent on invasive species management and research between 1996 to 2013. In 01–02, total national expenditure on invasive species was $2.31 billion, rising to $3.77 billion in 11–12. Agriculture accounted for more than 90% of the total cost. For 01–02 and 11–12, these expenditure figures equate to $123 and $197 per person per year respectively, as well as 0.32 and 0.29% of GDP respectively. All values provided here are most likely to be underestimates of the real values due to the significant constraints of the data obtainable. Invasive species are clearly a significant economic burden in Australia. Given the extent of the issue of invasive species globally, there is a clear need for better quantifications of both economic loss and expenditure in more jurisdictions, as well as in Australia.",

Some introduced species, like corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), plantation forests, domestic chicken (Gallus spp.), cattle (Bos taurus), and others, are beneficial and provide more than 98% of the world’s food supply. Precise economic costs associated with some of the most ecologically damaging alien species are not available. Cats (Felis cattus) and pigs (Sus scrofa), for example, are responsible for the extinction of various animal species, however, it is impossible to assign monetary values to species forced to extinction. The estimate is that non-native species invasions in the six nations are causing more than US$ 314 billion per year in damages.",

            "abstractNote": "The increasing number of invasive species and their effects on wildlife conservation, together with a lack of public resources, make it necessary to prioritize management actions. In practice, management decisions are often reached on the basis of subjective reasoning rather than scientific evidence. To develop a more evidence-based and efficient management of biological invasions, decision tools (e.g. multi-criteria frameworks) that help managers prioritize actions most efficiently are key. In this paper we review to what degree such decision tools are currently available. We used a literature search to identify relevant studies. Our analysis indicates that available studies are largely biased towards risk analysis and that only a few authors have proposed cost-benefit or multi-criteria frameworks for decision making. Until now, these frameworks have only been applied at limited regional scales but they could be applied more widely. Our review also shows critical biases in the geographical focus, habitats, and taxonomic groups of available studies. Most studies have focused on Europe, North America or Australia; other continents have largely been ignored. The majority of studies have focused on terrestrial plants; other habitats and taxonomic groups have been poorly covered. Most studies have focused on a single invasive species but practical management tools should consider a wide variety of invaders. We conclude with suggestions for developing improved decision tools.

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Invasive ants are amongst the most destructive and widespread invaders across the globe; they can strongly alter invaded ecosystems and are responsible for the loss of native ant species. Several studies have reported that invasive ants can also lead to substantial economic costs. In this study, we search, describe and analyse 1342 reported costs of invasive ants compiled in the InvaCost database. Economic costs, reported since 1930 for 12 ant species in 27 countries, totalled US$ 51.93 billion, from which US$ 10.95 billion were incurred, and US$ 40.98 billion were potential costs (i.e., expected or predicted costs). More than 80% of total costs were associated with only two species,\n              Solenopsis invicta\n              and\n              Wasmannia auropunctata\n              ; and two countries, the USA and Australia. Overall, damage costs amounted to 92% of the total cost, mainly impacting the agriculture, public and social welfare sectors. Management costs were primarily post-invasion management (US$ 1.79 billion), with much lower amounts dedicated to prevention (US$ 235.63 million). Besides the taxonomic bias, cost information was lacking for an average of 78% of the invaded countries. Moreover, even in countries where costs were reported, such information was available for only 56% of the invaded locations. Our synthesis suggests that the global costs of invasive ants are massive but largely biased towards developed economies, with a huge proportion of underreported costs, and thus most likely grossly underestimated. We advocate for more and improved cost reporting of invasive ants through better collaborations between managers, practitioners and researchers, a crucial basis for adequately informing future budgets and improving proactive management actions of invasive ants.\n            \n          , \n            Abstract in Spanish - Resumen en español\n            \n              El coste económico mundial de las hormigas invasoras\n            \n            \n              Las hormigas invasoras están entre las especies más destructivas y más ampliamente extendidas en todo el mundo. Pueden alterar fuertemente los ecosistemas y son responsables de la pérdida de numerosas especies de hormigas nativas en los ecosistemas invadidos. Muchos estudios han mostrado que las hormigas invasoras pueden producir costes económicos importantes. En este estudio, recopilamos, describimos y analizamos 1342 entradas de costes económicos de hormigas invasoras usando la base de datos InvaCost. Los costes económicos fueron reportados desde 1930, para 12 hormigas invasoras, en 27 países, alcanzando un total de $51.93 mil millones de dólares americanos de los cuales $10.95 mil millones fueron observados (costes reales) mientras que $40.98 mil millones de dólares americanos fueron costes potenciales (es decir, costes esperados, no observados). Más del 80% de los costes totales fueron causados por dos especies:\n              Solenopsis invicta\n              y\n              Wasmannia auropunctata\n              ; y en dos países: Estados Unidos y Australia. Los costes debidos a daños alcanzaron el 92% del total, afectando principalmente a los sectores agrícola y de bienestar social. Los costes de gestión se invirtieron en su mayoría en la gestión de post-invasión ($1.79 mil millones de dólares), con montos mucho menores de inversión en prevención ($235.63 millones de dólares). A nivel geográfico, falta información de reportes de costes económicos para aproximadamente un 78% de los países invadidos. Además, incluso en los países donde existían costes reportados, dicha información sólo estaba disponible para el 56% de los lugares invadidos. Nuestra síntesis sugiere que los costes globales de las hormigas invasoras son enormes pero en gran medida sesgados hacia las economías desarrolladas, con una gran proporción de costes sin reportar y por lo tanto gravemente subestimados. Exhortamos entonces, a un mayor y mejor reporte de los costes económicos de las hormigas invasoras a través de una mayor colaboración entre gestores, profesionales e investigadores; lo cual es la base crucial para informar adecuadamente presupuestos futuros y mejorar las actuaciones hacia una gestión proactiva de las hormigas invasoras.",

Recently, profound impacts have been attributed to invasive crustaceans, but associated monetary costs lack synthesis. Here, we analyse globally reported costs of invasive freshwater crayfish across taxonomic, spatial and temporal descriptors. Moreover, we compare their cost magnitude to other invasive crustaceans — crabs, amphipods and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 1.28 billion in reported costs; the vast majority (95%) attributed to Astacidae (principally the signal crayfish\n            Pacifastacus leniusculus\n            ) and the remainder to Cambaridae. According to reports, crayfish costs mostly impacted European economies (US$ 1.23 billion), followed by costs reported for North America and Asia. Despite well-known damages caused by invasive crayfish, costs were unreported elsewhere, highlighting knowledge gaps and challenges in cost quantifications. Invasive crayfish costs increased exponentially in the last two decades, averaging at US$ 61 million per-annum. Invasive crabs caused costs of similar magnitude (US$ 1.25 billion; US$ 53 million per-annum) but were mostly confined to North America (95%). Damage-related costs dominated for both crayfish (83%) and crabs (99%), with management spending lacking. Reported economic impacts from amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower. We identify burgeoning economic costs from these invasive groups yet highlight pervasive knowledge gaps at multiple scales. Further cost reporting is required to better-ascertain the true scale of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n          Many countries lack the economic capacity to effectively manage invasive species. Yet, the direct socioeconomic impact generally much outweighs the expected costs of prevention. A distinct lack of monetary cost quantification associated with key invasive species groups impedes decision-making, and thus resource allocation, by policy makers to address invasions. Here, we synthesize published global economic costs of impacts for one key taxonomic group – freshwater bivalves – whilst explicitly considering the reliability of estimation methodologies, cost types, economic sectors and impacted regions. Although several species from this group are notorious widespread invaders, estimations of their economic costs have remained relatively sparse. Cumulative total global costs of invasive macrofouling bivalves were US$ 63.6 billion (2017 USD) across all regions and socioeconomic sectors between 1980 and 2020. Costs were heavily biased taxonomically and spatially, dominated by two families, Dreissenidae and Cyrenidae (Corbiculidae), and largely constrained to North America. The largest share of reported costs ($ 30.6 billion) did not make the distinction between damage and management. However, of those that did, damages and resource losses were one order of magnitude higher ($ 30.3 billion) than control or preventative measures ($ 1.7 billion). Moreover, although many impacted socioeconomic sectors lacked specification, the largest shares of costs were incurred through authorities and stakeholders ($ 26.3 billion, e.g. public and private sector interventions) and by public and social welfare ($ 11.6 billion, e.g. via power/drinking water plant and irrigation system damage). Average cost estimates over the entire period amounted to approximately $ 1.6 billion per year, most of which was incurred in North America. We thus present novel cost quantifications that offer a strong economic incentive to invest in preventative management of invasive bivalves in freshwaters. However, these costs are severely underestimated because well-documented economic impacts are lacking for most invaded countries and most invasive bivalve species.",

            "abstractNote": "Although the high costs of invasion are frequently cited and are a key motivation for environmental management and policy, synthesised data on invasion costs are scarce. Here, we quantify and examine the monetary costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom (UK) using a global synthesis of reported invasion costs. Invasive alien species have cost the UK economy between US$6.9 billion and $17.6 billion (£5.4 – £13.7 billion) in reported losses and expenses since 1976. Most costs were reported for the entire UK or Great Britain (97%); country-scale cost reporting for the UK's four constituent countries was scarce. Reports of animal invasions were the costliest ($4.7 billion), then plant ($1.3 billion) and fungal ($206.7 million) invasions. Reported damage costs (i.e. excluding management costs) were higher in terrestrial ($4.8 billion) than aquatic or semi-aquatic environments ($29.8 million), and primarily impacted agriculture ($4.2 billion). Invaders with earlier introduction years accrued significantly higher total invasion costs. Invasion costs have been increasing rapidly since 1976, and have cost the UK economy $157.1 million (£122.1 million) per annum, on average. Published information on specific economic costs included only 42 of 520 invaders reported in the UK and was generally available only for the most intensively studied taxa, with just four species contributing 90% of species-specific costs. Given that many of the invasive species lacking cost data are actively managed and have well-recognised impacts, this suggests that cost information is incomplete and that totals presented here are vast underestimates owing to knowledge gaps. Financial expenditure on managing invasions is a fraction (37%) of the costs incurred through damage from invaders; greater investments in UK invasive species research and management are, therefore, urgently required.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions are a major component of anthropogenic environmental change, incurring substantial economic costs across all sectors of society and ecosystems. There have been recent syntheses of costs for a number of countries using the newly compiled InvaCost database, but New Zealand—a country renowned for its approach to invasive species management—has so far not been examined. Here we analyse reported economic damage and management costs incurred by biological invasions in New Zealand from 1968 to 2020. In total, US$69 billion (NZ$97 billion) is currently reported over this ∼50-year period, with approximately US$9 billion of this considered highly reliable, observed (c.f. projected) costs. Most (82%) of these observed economic costs are associated with damage, with comparatively little invested in management (18%). Reported costs are increasing over time, with damage averaging US$120 million per year and exceeding management expenditure in all decades. Where specified, most reported costs are from terrestrial plants and animals, with damages principally borne by primary industries such as agriculture and forestry. Management costs are more often associated with interventions by authorities and stakeholders. Relative to other countries present in the InvaCost database, New Zealand was found to spend considerably more than expected from its Gross Domestic Product on pre- and post-invasion management costs. However, some known ecologically (c.f. economically) impactful invasive species are notably absent from estimated damage costs, and management costs are not reported for a number of game animals and agricultural pathogens. Given these gaps for known and potentially damaging invaders, we urge improved cost reporting at the national scale, including improving public accessibility through increased access and digitisation of records, particularly in overlooked socioeconomic sectors and habitats. This also further highlights the importance of investment in management to curtail future damages across all sectors.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite the large body of knowledge recognising the impact of biological invasions on biodiversity, their economic impact has been less evaluated. However, the associated economic costs ought to provide useful information on many different aspects to prevent and manage invasions. Here, we describe the economic costs of biological invasions in Japan using InvaCost, a recently-published global database on monetary costs extracted from English and non-English sources, as well as a complementary search, thereby filling a gap in regional knowledge. We focused on the following four dimensions when analysing the economic costs of biological invasions: damage to biodiversity, damage to human livelihood, management for biodiversity and management for human livelihood. Interestingly, there was no information about biological invasion costs for Japan in English, but the Japanese search and our additional survey provided a total of 630 cost entries, with a total economic cost of 728 million USD (2017 value, equivalent to 62 billion JPY). These entries appeared in 33 documents and corresponded to a total of 54 species. We showed that: 1) damage costs from biological invasions tend not to be assessed as frequently as management costs and are more underestimated; 2) despite the numerous entries, an overwhelmingly limited amount of the management budget was allocated to biodiversity conservation compared to protecting human livelihood; 3) budgets have been intensively invested in invasive species management on small islands, which reflects the vulnerability of small island ecosystems and economies to biological invasions; 4) the recorded costs still seem to be greatly underestimated, mainly due to the lack of recording (and potentially limited access to recorded cost information). These findings are not only specific to Japan, but may also be widely applicable to most other countries. The future recording of economic costs will help to close the gap between actual and recorded costs, leading to more realistic guidelines for tackling biological invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "The impacts of invasive alien species are well-known and are categorised as a leading contributor to biodiversity loss globally. However, relatively little is known about the monetary costs incurred from invasions on national economies, hampering management responses. In this study, we used published data to describe the economic cost of invasions in Southeast Asia, with a focus on Singapore – a biodiversity-rich, tropical island city state with small size, high human density and high trade volume, three factors likely to increase invasions. In this country, as well as in others in Southeast Asia, cost data were scarce, with recorded costs available for only a small fraction of the species known to be invasive. Yet, the overall available economic costs to Singapore were estimated to be ~ US$ 1.72 billion in total since 1975 (after accounting for inflation), which is approximately one tenth of the total cost recorded in all of Southeast Asia (US$ 16.9 billion). These costs, in Singapore and Southeast Asia, were mostly linked to insects in the family Culicidae (principally\n              Aedes\n              spp.) and associated with damage, resource loss, healthcare and control-related spending. Projections for 11 additional species known to be invasive in Singapore, but with recorded costs only from abroad, amounted to an additional US$ 893.13 million, showing the potential huge gap between recorded and actual costs (cost records remain missing for over 90% of invasive species). No costs within the database for Singapore – or for other Southeast Asian countries – were exclusively associated with proactive management, highlighting that a shortage of reporting on the costs of invasions is mirrored by a lack of investment in management. Moreover, invasion cost entries in Singapore were under-reported relative to import levels, but total costs exceeded expectations, based on land area and population size, and to a greater extent than in other Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, the evaluation and reporting of economic costs of invasions need to be improved in this region to provide efficient data-based support for mitigation and management of their impacts.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive alien species are a well-known and pervasive threat to global biodiversity and human well-being. Despite substantial impacts of invasive alien species, quantitative syntheses of monetary costs incurred from invasions in national economies are often missing. As a consequence, adequate resource allocation for management responses to invasions has been inhibited, because cost-benefit analysis of management actions cannot be derived. To determine the economic cost of invasions in Germany, a Central European country with the 4\n              th\n              largest GDP in the world, we analysed published data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of invasive alien species. Overall, economic costs were estimated at US$ 9.8 billion between 1960 and 2020, including US$ 8.9 billion in potential costs. The potential costs were mostly linked to extrapolated costs of the American bullfrog\n              Lithobates catesbeianus\n              , the black cherry\n              Prunus serotina\n              and two mammals: the muskrat\n              Ondatra zibethicus\n              and the American mink\n              Neovison vison.\n              Observed costs were driven by a broad range of taxa and mostly associated with control-related spending and resource damages or losses. We identified a considerable increase in costs relative to previous estimates and through time. Importantly, of the 2,249 alien and 181 invasive species reported in Germany, only 28 species had recorded economic costs. Therefore, total quantifications of invasive species costs here should be seen as very conservative. Our findings highlight a distinct lack of information in the openly-accessible literature and governmental sources on invasion costs at the national level, masking the highly-probable existence of much greater costs of invasions in Germany. In addition, given that invasion rates are increasing, economic costs are expected to further increase. The evaluation and reporting of economic costs need to be improved in order to deliver a basis for effective mitigation and management of invasions on national and international economies.",
