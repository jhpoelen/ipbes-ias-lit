            "abstractNote": "Although research into the ecology and impacts of invasive species is prevalent, there are knowledge gaps relating to the role of invasive species in parasite transmission. This work synthesises invasive host–parasite interactions and impacts, using marine bivalves as a model group, to consider how global movement of shellfish consignments for aquaculture purposes facilitates the unintentional transfer of invasives. We discuss how invasive species can act as both hosts or parasitic organisms themselves, and introductions may lead to diseases within the bivalve aquaculture sector. This review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research, with particular regard to the fields of parasitology and invasion ecology. We suggest that further integrating these fields will enhance critical knowledge of marine diseases, parasite-invasive-bivalve interplay dynamics, and potential mitigation strategies, including temperature-based disease surveillance models. We also address how climate change might impact invasive species, again with a focus on marine bivalves, and the potential outcomes for parasite transmission, including changes in host/parasite distribution, life-history and virulence. We acknowledge the importance of horizon scanning for future invasive host–parasite introductions and note that increased screening of invasive species, both in their native and invaded ranges, will provide clarity on invasion dynamics and potential impacts.",

            "abstractNote": "The white peach scale Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) is a pest that causes significant damage to more than 221 genera of host plants in more than 112 countries. P. pentagona primarily feeds on mulberry, peach, and tea, and this leads to the loosening of the epidermis of trees, which damages nutrient and water transportation in the branches, leading to branch death. P. pentagona is native to China and Japan, and has become an invasive species all over the world. However, the potential distribution of P. pentagona remains unclear. In this study, a potential distribution map of P. pentagona was developed using current and future climate information using MaxEnt. The model indicates that Asia, Europe, South America and North America are a highly suitable habitat range for this species. The MaxEnt models for the potential distribution of P. pentagona for the 2050s and 2070s suggest that in the case of no significant increase or even decrease in the highly suitable area, the suitable area increased significantly on any future climatic scenarios. The predicted area gain in the suitable habitat is 2.82 x 10(7) km(2), including more of Asia, such as China, Japan, and Mongolia, and also including India, Vietnam, Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Austria, The Czech Republic, Italy, and Germany in Europe, which shows an increase of 24.5% over the current habitat on RCP8.5 emission scenarios for the 2070s. With the warming of the climate, significant expansions are predicted in the suitable area, especially in Europe and East Asia. Under RCP8.5 for the 2050s, the model-predicted that the area of suitable habitat in China and the Korean Peninsula gains an increase of 18.8% over the current suitable habitat area. Under other climate scenarios, RCP8.5-2070s, the suitable areas were the largest, compared to projection for the current climate scenario (ca. 24.1% increase) which increased to 7.89 x 10(6) km(2). In Europe, under RCP8.5 for the 2070s, the highly suitable areas were the largest, compared to the projection for the current climate scenario (ca. 46.2% increase), which increased to 8.64 x 10(5) km(2), the area of suitable habitat suitability increased to 4.99 x 10(6) km(2) (29.2% increase of the current condition). Potential increases or decreases in distribution ranges were modeled under future climatic scenarios. This study suggests that the most important factor that influenced current distribution of this pest was temperature, and BIO3 (isothermality) was the most important factor that contributed to 48.6% of the potential distribution map. Given the rapid spread of P. pentagona and the serious risk this species poses to local ecosystems, warning modelling and practical strategies to prevent the establishment and expansion of this species should be sought. This distribution map will help governments to identify areas that are suitable for current and future infestations, and to optimize pest management strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica (Newman), is a severe invasive insect pest of turf, landscapes, and horticultural crops. It has successfully colonized much of the United States and has recently established in mainland Europe. The distribution and voltinism of P. japonica will undoubtedly change as a consequence of climate change, posing additional challenges to the management of this species. To assess these challenges, a process-oriented bioclimatic niche model for P. japonica was developed to examine its potential global distribution under current (1981-2010) and projected climatic conditions (2040-2059) using one emission scenario (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5) and two global climate models, ACCESS1-0 and CNRM-CM5. Under current climatic conditions, the bioclimatic niche model agreed well with all credible distribution data. Model projections indicate a strong possibility of further range expansion throughout mainland Europe under both current and future climates. In North America, projected increases in temperature would enable northward range expansion across Canada while simultaneously shifting southern range limits in the United States. In Europe, the suitable range for P. japonica would increase by 23% by midcentury, especially across portions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, cumulative growing degree-days increased, thereby reducing the probability of biannual life cycles in northern latitudes where they can occur, including Hokkaido, Japan, northeastern portions of the United States, and southern Ontario, Canada. The results of this study highlight several regions of increasing and emerging risk from P. japonica that should be considered routinely in ongoing biosecurity and pest management surveys.",

            "abstractNote": "Plant pathogens are introduced to new geographical regions ever more frequently as global connectivity increases. Predicting the threat they pose to plant health can be difficult without in-depth knowledge of behaviour, distribution and spread. Here, we evaluate the potential for using biological traits and phylogeny to predict global threats from emerging pathogens. We use a species-level trait database and phylogeny for 179 Phytophthora species: oomycete pathogens impacting natural, agricultural, horticultural and forestry settings. We compile host and distribution reports for Phytophthora species across 178 countries and evaluate the power of traits, phylogeny and time since description (reflecting species-level knowledge) to explain and predict their international transport, maximum latitude and host breadth using Bayesian phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models. In the best-performing models, traits, phylogeny and time since description together explained up to 90%, 97% and 87% of variance in number of countries reached, latitudinal limits and host range, respectively. Traits and phylogeny together explained up to 26%, 41% and 34% of variance in the number of countries reached, maximum latitude and host plant families affected, respectively, but time since description had the strongest effect. Root-attacking species were reported in more countries, and on more host plant families than foliar-attacking species. Host generalist pathogens had thicker-walled resting structures (stress-tolerant oospores) and faster growth rates at their optima. Cold-tolerant species are reported in more countries and at higher latitudes, though more accurate interspecific empirical data are needed to confirm this finding. Policy implications. We evaluate the potential of an evolutionary trait-based framework to support horizon-scanning approaches for identifying pathogens with greater potential for global-scale impacts. Potential future threats from Phytophthora include Phytophthora x heterohybrida, P. lactucae, P. glovera, P. x incrassata, P. amnicola and P. aquimorbida, which are recently described, possibly under-reported species, with similar traits and/or phylogenetic proximity to other high-impact species. Priority traits to measure for emerging species may be thermal minima, oospore wall index and growth rate at optimum temperature. Trait-based horizon-scanning approaches would benefit from the development of international and cross-sectoral collaborations to deliver centralised databases incorporating pathogen distributions, traits and phylogeny.",

            "abstractNote": "AimMany species of ascidians are invasive and can cause both ecological and economic losses. Here, we describe risk assessment for nineteen ascidian species and predict coastal regions that are more vulnerable to arrival and expansion. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe used ensemble niche modelling with three algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and MaxEnt) to predict ecologically suitable areas and evaluated our predictions using independent (area under the curveAUC) and dependent thresholds (true skill statisticsTSS). Environmental variables were maximum and the range of sea surface temperature, mean salinity and maximum chlorophyll. We used our niche modelling results and a modified invasibility index to compare invasion risk among 15 coastal regions. ResultsCurrently, the most invaded regions are in temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and Temperate Australasia, which are regions most prone for new invasions. In the tropics, the West and Central Indo-Pacific are two regions of strong concern, the former with high risk of primary invasion by Botryllus schlosseri and Didemnum perlucidum. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Southwest and Southeast Atlantic are most at risk, both subject to invasion by Botrylloides violaceus, Didemnum vexillum, Molgula manhattensis and Styela clava among others. Regions most at risk of expansion of established invasive species are the Central Indo-Pacific, Northwest Pacific, Mediterranean and West Indo-Pacific. Main conclusionsAll regions studied have areas that are suitable and connected to receive new ascidian introductions or that may permit the spread of already established species. Risk comparison of primary introductions and expansion of established introduced ascidians among regions will allow managers to prioritize species of concern for each region both for monitoring future introductions or to enforce control actions towards established species to decrease the risk of regional expansion.",

In the risk model, sales volumes of individual taxa were used as a proxy for propagule pressure, to assess pathway risk potential. Organism risk potential, the ability to become established and disperse associated with a release, was assessed using an analysis of the biological traits of the species. Discriminant correspondence analysis was used to predict which biological traits were useful in discriminating native plants from alien invasive plants and alien non‐invasive plants. Importantly, a relatively small number of biological traits appear to be useful in predicting whether an alien aquatic plant had the characteristics that would support establishment and/or dispersal in new environments. Aquatic plants distributed by the industries that are cold tolerant, able to propagate by fragments and use a number of dispersal methods are of particular concern as potential invaders. The model identified 11 alien plants in the trade that have a high risk of becoming invasive, and an additional 52 with moderately high risk.",

This mite has spread rapidly to several Caribbean countries, United States of America, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil. The potential dispersion of R. indica to other regions of South America could seriously impact the cultivation of coconuts, bananas, exotic and native palms and tropical flowers such as the Heliconiaceae. To facilitate the development of efficacious R. indica management techniques such as the adoption of phytosanitary measures to prevent or delay the dispersion of this pest, the objective of this paper was to estimate the potential geographical distribution of R. indica in South America using a maximum entropy model. The R. indica occurrence data used in this model were obtained from extant literature, online databases and field sampling data. The model predicted potential suitable areas for R. indica in northern Colombia, central and northern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, east French Guiana and many parts of Brazil, including Roraima, the eastern Amazonas, northern Para, Amapa and the coastal zones, from Para to north of Rio de Janeiro. These results indicate the potential for significant R. indica related economic and social impacts in all of these countries, particularly in Brazil, because the suitable habitat regions overlap with agricultural areas for R. indica host plants such as coconuts and bananas.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species have imposed huge negative impacts on worldwide aquatic ecosystems and are generally difficult or impossible to be eradicated once established. Consequently, it becomes particularly important to ascertain their invasion risk and its determinants since such information can help us formulate more effective preventive or management actions and direct these measures to those areas where they are truly needed so as to ease regulatory burdens. Here, we examined the global invasion risk and its determinants of sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), one freshwater fish which has a high invasive potential, by using species distribution models (SDMs) and a layer overlay method. Specifically, first an ensemble species distribution model and its basal models (developed from seven machine learning algorithms) were explored to forecast the global habitat-suitability and variables importance for this species, and then a global invasion risk map was created by combining habitat-suitability with a proxy for introduction likelihood (entailing propagule pressure and dispersal constraints) of exotic sharpbelly. The results revealed that (1) the ensemble model had the highest predictive power in forecasting sharpbelly's global habitat-suitability; (2) areas with high invasion risk by sharpbelly patchily spread over the world except Antarctica; and (3) the Human Influence Index (HII), rather than any of the bioclimatic variables, was the most important factor influencing sharpbelly' future invasion. Based on these results, the present study also attempted to propose a series of prevention and management strategies to eliminate or alleviate the adverse effects caused by this species' further expansion.

            "abstractNote": "Efficient management and prevention of species invasions requires accurate prediction of where species of concern can arrive and persist. Species distribution models provide one way to identify potentially suitable habitat by developing the relationship between climate variables and species occurrence data. However, these models when applied to freshwater invasions are complicated by two factors. The first is that the range expansions that typically occur as part of the invasion process violate standard species distribution model assumptions of data stationarity. Second, predicting potential range of freshwater aquatic species is complicated by the reliance on terrestrial climate measurements to develop occurrence relationships for species that occur in aquatic environments. To overcome these obstacles, we combined a recently developed algorithm for species distribution modeling-range bagging-with newly available aquatic habitat-specific information from the North American Great Lakes region to predict suitable habitat for three potential invasive species: golden mussel, killer shrimp, and northern snakehead. Range bagging may more accurately predict relative suitability than other methods because it focuses on the limits of the species environmental tolerances rather than central tendency or “typical” cases. Overlaying the species distribution model output with aquatic habitat-specific data then allowed for more specific predictions of areas with high suitability. Our results indicate there is suitable habitat for northern snakehead in the Great Lakes, particularly shallow coastal habitats in the lower four Great Lakes where literature suggests they will favor areas of wetland and submerged aquatic vegetation. These coastal areas also offer the highest suitability for golden mussel, but our models suggest they are marginal habitats. Globally, the Great Lakes provide the closest match to the currently invaded range of killer shrimp, but they appear to pose an intermediate risk to the region. Range bagging provided reliable predictions when assessed either by a standard test set or by tests for spatial transferability, with golden mussel being the most difficult to accurately predict. Our approach illustrates the strength of combining multiple sources of data, while reiterating the need for increased measurement of freshwater habitat at high spatial resolutions to improve the ability to predict potential invasive species.",

World distribution maps of recognised insect pest species were used to record the presence or absence of each species within the identified analogous regions. South-east Australia, western Europe and the east coast of the United States are climatically very similar to Auckland, New Zealand, and furthermore, New Zealand shares many insect pest species with these regions. Since these regions also have close trade and tourism links with New Zealand, any new insect incursions recorded within these analogous climates should be of concern to biosecurity authorities in New Zealand. Consequent risk analysis could be more efficient at identifying potentially harmful organisms and reduce the chances of a new pest establishing in New Zealand.",

A number of species-specific invasion predictions that correspond to environmental conditions are available, but literature predicting global species invasion that corresponds to environmental conditions and human activity is scarce. In this study, the potential geographic ranges of 308 alien plant species were predicted under current environmental conditions and human activities. Environmental conditions were delineated by bioclimatic (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean temperature of wettest quarter, and precipitation of driest quarter) and topographic variables (annual solar radiation and topographic wetness index). Human activity was delineated by the human footprint, which is a raster data layer created from nine global data layers that describe human population pressure, land use and infrastructure, and human access. The potential distribution of the target species was predicted using the different types of models. By searching the correlated literature, we identified and excluded the native geographic range of the studied species in the predicted geographic range to obtain the exclusive invasive range. Results demonstrated that the invasion hotspots included the southern part of North America, Southern and Western Europe, the south coast of Asia, coastal regions of Australia and New Zealand, the coast of West Africa, the Ivory Coast of Africa, and the southern part of Brazil. In addition, the land areas of the low-(proper for less than 50 alien species), moderate-(51-100 aliens), and high-risk regions (more than 100 aliens) are 213.23, 18.15, and 2.50 million km(2), respectively. All variables (bioclimatic and topographic variables and human footprint) were positively correlated with increasing richness of alien species. The highest correlation coefficient was obtained for the human footprint.",

            "abstractNote": "Light brown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana is a significant horticultural pest native to Australia that currently has a limited global distribution. However, this pest can tolerate very heterogeneous climates and has a wide host range. It has recently established in California with considerable consequences for US international and domestic trade. It has resulted in increasing calls for targeted risk assessment so that appropriate quarantine measures can be put in place to prevent its entry into new regions and further spread. Potential global distribution has been predicted by comparing the climatic conditions of its native (Australia) and long-established (New Zealand) ranges to the rest of the world using CLIMEX. It was suggested that E. postvittana has potential to establish mainly in countries in Central and South America, southern Africa, Western Europe and Southeast Asia. The study provides basic information for further assessment of the establishment capacity of this species in new habitats, and adds to the knowledge required to make science-based decisions in biosecurity.

In May 2016, it was found for the first time in Australia, with further sampling confirming it was widespread throughout south-eastern regions. Russian wheat aphid is not yet present in New Zealand. The impacts of this pest if it establishes in New Zealand, could result in serious control problems in wheat- and barley-growing regions. To evaluate whether\n              D. noxia\n              could establish populations in New Zealand we used the climate modelling software CLIMEX to locate where potential viable populations might occur. We re-parameterised the existing CLIMEX model by Hughes and Maywald (1990) by improving the model fit using currently known distribution records of\n              D. noxia\n              , and we also considered the role of irrigation into the potential spread of this invasive insect. The updated model now fits the current known distribution better than the previous Hughes and Maywald CLIMEX model, particularly in temperate and Mediterranean areas in Australia and Europe; and in more semi-arid areas in north-western China and Middle Eastern countries. Our model also highlights new climatically suitable areas for the establishment of\n              D. noxia\n              , not previously reported, including parts of France, the UK and New Zealand. Our results suggest that, when suitable host plants are present, Russian wheat aphid could establish in these regions. The new CLIMEX projections in the present study are useful tools to inform risk assessments and target surveillance and monitoring efforts for identifying susceptible areas to invasion by Russian wheat aphid.",

            "abstractNote": "Climate is a determinant factor in species distribution and climate change will affect the species abilities to occupy geographic regions. Prosopis juliflora is one of the most problematic invasive species and its biological invasion causes various negative effects in tropical, arid, and semi-arid regions of the world. As eradication efforts subsequent to the establishment of an alien invasive species are costly and time-consuming, assessing patterns of the introduction of an invasive species to new regions is among the most cost-effective means of monitoring and management of natural ecosystems. In this study by using the concept of species distribution modeling (SDM) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method, the effect of climate change on the current and future distribution of P. juliflora has been assessed at a global scale. Bioclimatic variables in current condition and 2050 regarding two global circulation models (GCM) and two climate change scenarios were considered as explanatory variables. Our results showed that annual mean temperature (BIO1), annual precipitation (BIO12), and temperature mean diurnal range (BIO2) represented more than 87% of the variations in the model, and with an AUC of 0.854 and TSS of 0.51, the model showed a good predictive performance. Our results indicate that on a global scale, suitable ranges for P. juliflora increase across all the GCM and RCP scenarios. In a global scale, Mediterranean Basin, Middle East, and North America are regions with the highest risk of range expansion in the future. Regarding the negative impacts of P. juliflora on structure and function of natural habitats in the invaded areas, findings of this study could be considered as a warning appliance for the environmental monitoring of the regions highly sensitive to the global invasion of the species. We suggest that assessing impacts of climate change on the global distribution of the invasive species could be used as an efficient tool to implement broad-scale and priority-setting monitoring programs in natural ecosystems.",

This study is dedicated to determine the plant diversity and to assess the vulnerability of Quezon Protected Landscape, Southern Luzon, the Philippines to invasive alien plant species. Data from 90 10x10 m randomly established plots using the quadrat method showed that there are 318 plant species wherein 208 are native, 100 are non-native, and 10 are invasive. Results from the association of the physicochemical factors and the presence of invasive alien plant species through Spearman rho test revealed that most of the physicochemical factors have significant association except percent slope and hill shade. Soil pH, aspect and number of non-native plants show positive association while soil moisture, leaf litter thickness, elevation, species richness, species evenness, plot species diversity index, and the number of native plants signify negative association. Differences between the plots of with and without invasive alien plant species in physicochemical factors indicate that most of the physicochemical factors have a significant difference between plots of with and without invasive alien plant species except percent slope, hill shade, and aspect. Lastly, the MaxEnt model exemplifies that the most suitable predicted conditions for invasive alien plant species are at the edges of boundary and buffer zones. This study implies that most of the physicochemical factors are linked to the presence of invasive alien plant species and Quezon Protected Landscape has a low vulnerability to invasive alien plant species invasion.

However, this effort has been challenging, especially for global invaders. Our goal was to test whether potential ranges of global invaders can be predicted, and examine the factors that shape them by studying the past, current and potential global distribution of a broad-ranging avian invader. We used the common myna (Acridotheres tristis), one of the most broad-ranging avian invaders whose range is currently expanding globally, as a case study. We collected the first detailed global database of global occurrence (n=7990) of the common myna over the past 150years, including records from the native and the introduced ranges. We employed MaxEnt to construct species distribution models (SDM) for the global database using climatic, anthropogenic and environmental factors. We provide evidence that invasive species distributions can be predicted from older records, and that model accuracy requires integrating data from the introduced range. This first comprehensive distribution for an avian invader indicates an extensive expansion in the common myna global distribution, with the potential of large areas worldwide being at risk of common myna invasion, thus threatening local biodiversity globally. Range expansion has been facilitated by proximity to urbanized areas and broad environmental tolerance. Our findings reflect the major role of anthropogenic impact in increasing the global distribution of avian invaders and emphasize the value of using SDMs to inform global management practices.",

            "abstractNote": "The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is a dangerous pathogen to salamanders and newts. Apparently native to Asia, it has recently been detected in Western Europe where it is expected to spread and to have dramatic effects on naïve hosts. Since 2010, Bsal has led to some catastrophic population declines of urodeles in the Netherlands and Belgium. More recently, it has been discovered in additional, more distant sites including sites in Germany. With the purpose to contribute to a better understanding of Bsal, we modelled its potential distribution in its invasive European range to gain insights about the factors driving this distribution. We computed Bsal Maxent models for two predictor sets, which represent different temporal resolutions, using three different background extents to account for different invasion stage scenarios. Beside ‘classical’ bioclimate, we employed weather data, which allowed us to emphasize predictors in accordance with the known pathogen’s biology. The most important predictors as well as spatial predictions varied between invasion scenarios and predictor sets. The most reasonable model was based on weather data and the scenario of a recent pathogen introduction. It identified temperature predictors, which represent optimal growing conditions and heat limiting conditions, as the most explaining drivers of the current distribution. This model also predicted large areas in the study region as suitable for Bsal. The other models predicted considerably less, but shared some areas which we interpreted as most likely high risk zones. Our results indicate that growth relevant temperatures measured under laboratory conditions might also be relevant on a macroecological scale, if predictors with a high temporal resolution and relevance are used. Additionally, the conditions in our study area support the possibility of a further Bsal spread, especially when considering that our models might tend to underestimate the potential distribution of Bsal.",

Some countries restrict the import of fresh citrus fruit from countries where G. citricarpa occurs. A CLIMEX model was previously used to predict the climatic suitability of Europe for potential establishment of the organism, but the European Food Safety Authority criticised aspects of that study. Distributions in South Africa, Australia and Taiwan were used to develop a new set of parameter values that provide a better fit to the known distribution of G. citricarpa and provide confidence that the model is a distinct improvement over that of previous modelling efforts. The new CLIMEX model correctly reflects climatic suitability of all regions in the world where the organism is known to occur. The model indicates that most of Europe is completely unsuitable for the establishment of G. citricarpa. Within European citrus producing regions, suitable areas are highly constrained, never more than marginally suitable, and all have lower levels of suitability than any area in South Africa and Australia where G. citricarpa is known to occur. It is concluded that the potential risk of G. citricarpa establishment in these regions is exceedingly low.",

With a changing climate, there is the potential for this pest to further expand its distribution and become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions. To examine this possibility, we developed bioclimatic envelope models for both the bean leaf beetle, and its most important agronomic host plant, soybean (Glycine max). These two models were combined to examine the potential future pest status of the beetle using climate change projections from multiple general circulation models (GCMs) and climate change scenarios. Despite the broad tolerances of soybean, incorporation of host plant availability substantially decreased the suitable and favourable areas for the bean leaf beetle as compared to an evaluation based solely on the climate envelope of the beetle, demonstrating the importance of incorporating biotic interactions in these predictions. The use of multiple GCM–scenario combinations also revealed differences in predictions depending on the choice of GCM, with scenario choice having less of an impact. While the Norwegian model predicted little northward expansion of the beetle from its current northern range limit of southern Ontario and overall decreases in suitable and favourable areas over time, the Canadian and Russian models predict that much of Ontario and Quebec will become suitable for the beetle in the future, as well as Manitoba under the Russian model. The Russian model also predicts expansion of the suitable and favourable areas for the beetle over time. Two predictions that do not depend on our choice of GCM include a decrease in suitability of the Mississippi Delta region and continued favourability of the southeastern United States.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim: Non-native invasive insects have major impacts on ecosystem function, agricultural production and human health. To predict the geographical distributions of these species, correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) are typically used. Such methods rely on assumptions of niche conservatism, although there is increasing evidence that many species undergo niche shifts during invasions. The magnitude and direction of niche shifts, however, is likely to vary within and between taxonomic groups, highlighting that an assessment of potential niche shifts in such insects is required. Location: Global. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Insects. Methods: We compile a novel database of 22 globally invasive, non-native insect species and test for niche expansion and unfilling across this group. We examine if factors such as the native range size, poleward shifts and human influence may be associated with observed niche changes. Finally, we construct ENMs and examine the reliability of their predictions in light of our niche shift results. Results: Niche expansion was apparent in 12 of the 22 species, suggesting that altered species-climate relationships during invasion is common for this group. Likewise, niche unfilling occurred in 15 of the species. Increasing human disturbance (combining human population, transport networks and land use) explained 40% of observed niche expansions and 54% of incidents of niche unfilling. Niche metrics and ENM performance were sensitive to the choice of background extents. Main conclusions: Many non-native insects expand into new climates in their invasive ranges. The prevalence of niche unfilling across this group suggests climate disequilibrium and the potential for further range expansion. Non-native invasive insects tend to invade areas with similar human disturbance to their native range, and habitat accessibility appears important for these species to achieve their full invasion range potential. Ideally, ENMs should not be used in isolation for this group, but should be coupled with other methods or experiments to test for potential niche change.",

            "abstractNote": "The small cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae, is a major agricultural pest of cruciferous crops and has been introduced to every continent except South America and Antarctica as a result of human activities. In an effort to reconstruct the near-global invasion history of P. rapae, we developed a citizen science project, the “Pieris Project,” and successfully amassed thousands of specimens from 32 countries worldwide. We then generated and analyzed nuclear (double-digest restriction site-associated DNA fragment procedure [ddRAD]) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data for these samples to reconstruct and compare different global invasion history scenarios. Our results bolster historical accounts of the global spread and timing of P. rapae introductions. We provide molecular evidence supporting the hypothesis that the ongoing divergence of the European and Asian subspecies of P. rapae (∼1,200 y B.P.) coincides with the diversification of brassicaceous crops and the development of human trade routes such as the Silk Route (Silk Road). The further spread of P. rapae over the last ∼160 y was facilitated by human movement and trade, resulting in an almost linear series of at least 4 founding events, with each introduced population going through a severe bottleneck and serving as the source for the next introduction. Management efforts of this agricultural pest may need to consider the current existence of multiple genetically distinct populations. Finally, the international success of the Pieris Project demonstrates the power of the public to aid scientists in collections-based research addressing important questions in invasion biology, and in ecology and evolutionary biology more broadly. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

            "abstractNote": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are an emerging tool in the study of fungi, and their use is expanding across species and research topics. To summarise progress to date and to highlight important considerations for future users, we review 283 studies that apply SDMs to fungi. We found that macrofungi, lichens, and pathogenic microfungi are most often studied. While many studies only aim to model species response to environmental covariates, the use of SDMs for explicitly predicting fungal occurrence in space and time is growing. Many studies collect fungal occurrence data, but the use of pre-collected records from reference collections and citizen science programs is increasing. Challenges of applying SDMs to fungi include detection and sampling biases, and uncertainties in identification and taxonomy. Further, finding environmental covariates at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is important, as fungi can respond to fine-scale environmental patterns. Fine-scale covariate data can be difficult to gather across space, but we show remote-sensing measurements are viable for fungi SDMs. For those fungi interacting with host species, host information is also important, and can be used as covariates in SDMs. We also highlight that competition among fungi, and dispersal, can affect observed distributions, with the latter particularly prominent for invasive fungi. We show how one can account for these processes in models, when suitable data are available. Finally, we note that environmental DNA records create new opportunities and challenges for future modelling efforts, and discuss the difficulties in predicting invasions and climate change impacts. The application of SDMs to fungi has already provided interesting lessons on how to adapt modelling tools for specific questions, and fungi will continue to be relevant test subjects for further technical development of SDMs.",

            "abstractNote": "Erythrina gall wasp, Quadrastichus erythrinae Kim, was first described in 2004. It has become a gall-inducing invader and can result in the death of Erythrina trees in affected areas. The most serious aspect of the threat was its enormous expansion rate and sudden outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to predict the potential geographical distribution of erythrina gall wasp on a global scale. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) was used to analyze its potential expansion based on occurrence records and environmental data. The results indicate that Q. erythrinae will affect wide areas of Asia, Africa, Oceania, South America, and reach the southern part of North America. The predicted potential range is far-reaching and pan-tropical, and includes tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, subtropical monsoon and tropical savannah climates. Vegetation types and humidity are predicted to be limiting factors for its spread. Based on the currently reported distribution pattern and predicted ranges of expansion of the erythrina gall wasp, it is possible that Africa was the area of origin.",

This study was conducted to identify suitable areas for the occurrence of four Diabrotica species and to assess the potential impact of these species in a scenario of invasion followed by spread throughout the estimated suitable regions. RESULTSOur findings reveal that a large proportion of the suitable areas for Diabrotica species overlap with cultivated areas. Niche analyses also demonstrated that these species occupy a small proportion of the suitable habitats available to them, indicating that, if new areas are invaded, there is a risk of spread throughout adjacent regions. CONCLUSIONMost of the suitable areas for Diabrotica species overlap with highly productive agricultural areas, suggesting that a potential spread of these species may cause economic loss. Our study provides a valuable contribution to the development of tools aiming to predict the potential spread of these species throughout the world. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",

            "abstractNote": "Online community and citizen science (CCS) projects have broadened access to scientific research and enabled different forms of participation in biodiversity research; however, little is known about whether and how such opportunities are taken up by young people (aged 5–19). Furthermore, when they do participate, there is little research on whether their online activity makes a tangible contribution to scientific research. We addressed these knowledge gaps using quantitative analytical approaches and visualisations to investigate 249 youths’ contributions to CCS on the iNaturalist platform, and the potential for the scientific use of their contributions. We found that nearly all the young volunteers’ observations were ‘verifiable’ (included a photo, location, and date/time) and therefore potentially useful to biodiversity research. Furthermore, more than half were designated as ‘Research Grade’, with a community agreed-upon identification, making them more valuable and accessible to biodiversity science researchers. Our findings show that young volunteers with lasting participation on the platform and those aged 16–19 years are more likely to have a higher proportion of Research Grade observations than younger, or more ephemeral participants. This study enhances our understanding of young volunteers’ contributions to biodiversity research, as well as the important role professional scientists and data users can play in helping verify youths’ contributions to make them more accessible for biodiversity research.",

            "abstractNote": "Growing concerns about the quality of aggregated biodiversity data are lowering trust in large-scale data networks. Aggregators frequently respond to quality concerns by recommending that biologists work with original data providers to correct errors 'at the source.' We show that this strategy falls systematically short of a full diagnosis of the underlying causes of distrust. In particular, trust in an aggregator is not just a feature of the data signal quality provided by the sources to the aggregator, but also a consequence of the social design of the aggregation process and the resulting power balance between individual data contributors and aggregators. The latter have created an accountability gap by downplaying the authorship and significance of the taxonomic hierarchies - frequently called 'backbones' - they generate, and which are in effect novel classification theories that operate at the core of data-structuring process. The Darwin Core standard for sharing occurrence records plays an under-appreciated role in maintaining the accountability gap, because this standard lacks the syntactic structure needed to preserve the taxonomic coherence of data packages submitted for aggregation, potentially leading to inferences that no individual source would support. Since high-quality data packages can mirror competing and conflicting classifications, i.e. unsettled systematic research, this plurality must be accommodated in the design of biodiversity data integration. Looking forward, a key directive is to develop new technical pathways and social incentives for experts to contribute directly to the validation of taxonomically coherent data packages as part of a greater, trustworthy aggregation process.",

            "abstractNote": "Biotic and abiotic factors are increasingly acknowledged to synergistically shape broad-scale species distributions. However, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting species distributions is unclear. In particular, biotic factors, such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse biotic factors, including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. Abiotic factors, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally. This information can be used to proactively create conservation/management plans to control future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the ongoing paradigm shift, which recognizes that both biotic and abiotic factors shape species distributions across broad scales, can be advanced by incorporating diverse biotic factors.",

Environmental Niche Modelling has emerged as a powerful tool to predict the patterns of range expansion of non-native species and to direct effective strategies for managing biological invasions. The raccoon, Procyon lotor, is a wild mesocarnivore presenting a high adaptability and showing successful introduced populations worldwide. Here, we modelled the current and future climatically favourable areas for the raccoon using two protocols, based on data sets filtrated in geographic and environmental spaces. Projections from these models show extensive current favourable geographical areas covering extensive regions of temperate biomes. Moreover, predictions for 2050 reveals extensive new favourable areas north of the current favourable regions. However, the results of the two modeling approaches differ in the extent of predicted favourable spaces. Protocols using geographically filtered data present more conservative forecasts, while protocol using environmental filtration presents forecasts across greater areas. Given the biological characteristics and the ecological requirements of a generalist carnivore such as the raccoon, the latter forecasts appears more relevant and should be privileged in the development of conservation plans for ecosystems.",

This is the first study of B. tabaci (Biotype B and Q) global distribution, focusing on risk levels of this invasive pest, in areas projected to be suitable for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation under climate change. This study aims to identify levels of risk of invasive B. tabaci for areas of suitability for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation for the present, 2050 and 2070 using MaxEnt and the Global Climate Model, HadGEM2_ES under RCP45. Our results show that 5% of areas optimal for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation are currently at high risk of B. tabaci. Among the optimal areas for S. lycopersicum, the projections for 2050 compared to the current time showed an extension of 180% in areas under high risk, and a shortening of 67 and 27% in areas under medium and low risk of B. tabaci, respectively, while projections for 2070 showed an extension of 164, and a shortening of 49 and 64% under high, medium and low risk, respectively. The basis of these projections is that predicted temperature increases could affect the pest, which has great adaptability to different climate conditions, but could also impose limitations on the growth of S. lycopersicum. These results may be used in designing strategies to prevent the introduction and establishment of B. tabaci for open-field tomato crops, and assist the implementation of pest management programs.",

We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3–34.0˚C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9–29.4˚C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climatedriven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.",

We use tools from ecological niche modeling in combination with occurrence records from herbarium specimens to evaluate the global invasive potential of each of 10 species in this assemblage, representing several of the worst global invaders. The invasive potential of these species is considerable, with all tropical and subtropical countries, and most temperate countries, vulnerable to invasions by one or more of them.",

The economic losses associated with biological invasions of other fruit flies around the world and the polyphagous behaviour of B. carambolae have prompted much concern among government agencies and farmers with the potential spread of this pest. Here, ecological niche models were employed to identify suitable environments available to B. carambolae in a global scale and assess the extent of the fruit acreage that may be at risk of attack in Brazil. Overall, 30 MaxEnt models built with different combinations of environmental predictors and settings were evaluated for predicting the potential distribution of the carambola fruit fly. The best model was selected based on threshold-independent and threshold-dependent metrics. Climatically suitable areas were identified in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, west and east coast of India and northern Australia. The suitability map of B. carambola was intersected against maps of fruit acreage in Brazil. The acreage under potential risk of attack varied widely among fruit species, which is expected because the production areas are concentrated in different regions of the country. The production of cashew is the one that is at higher risk, with almost 90% of its acreage within the suitable range of B. carambolae, followed by papaya (78%), tangerine (51%), guava (38%), lemon (30%), orange (29%), mango (24%) and avocado (20%). This study provides an important contribution to the knowledge of the ecology of B. carambolae, and the information generated here can be used by government agencies as a decision-making tool to prevent the carambola fruit fly spread across the world.",

To explore the potential dimensions of this geographic expansion, we used ecological niche modeling based on known occurrences of the species on its native distributional area, in the context of GIS data sets describing climatic variables, topographic information, and human presence. Our models provided predictions of areas already invaded that were statistically significantly more coincident than expected under random (null) models. The predicted potential range of the species includes areas already affected, as well as potentially suitable areas in Central America, the Caribbean, equatorial and West Africa, and mainland and insular Southeast Asia, not yet colonized.",

While much research has focused on parasites that infect single host species, most parasites of domesticated mammals infect multiple species. The impact of multihost parasites varies across hosts; some rarely result in death, whereas others are nearly always fatal. Despite their high ecological and societal costs, we currently lack theory for predicting the lethality of multihost parasites. Here, using a global dataset of >4,000 case-fatality rates for 65 infectious diseases (caused by microparasites and macroparasites) and 12 domesticated host species, we show that the average evolutionary distance from an infected host to other mammal host species is a strong predictor of disease-induced mortality. We find that as parasites infect species outside of their documented phylogenetic host range, they are more likely to result in lethal infections, with the odds of death doubling for each additional 10 million years of evolutionary distance. Our results for domesticated animal diseases reveal patterns in the evolution of highly lethal parasites that are difficult to observe in the wild and further suggest that the severity of infectious diseases may be predicted from evolutionary relationships among hosts.",

            "abstractNote": "Crop pests and pathogens (CPPs) present a growing threat to food security and ecosystem management. The interactions between plants and their natural enemies are inﬂuenced by environmental conditions and thus global warming and climate change could affect CPP ranges and impact. Observations of changing CPP distributions over the twentieth century suggest that growing agricultural production and trade have been most important in disseminating CPPs, but there is some evidence for a latitudinal bias in range shifts that indicates a global warming signal. Species distribution models using climatic variables as drivers suggest that ranges will shift latitudinally in the future. The rapid spread of the Colorado potato beetle across Eurasia illustrates the importance of evolutionary adaptation, host distribution, and migration patterns in affecting the predictions of climate-based species distribution models. Understanding species range shifts in the framework of ecological niche theory may help to direct future research needs.",

The sources of these pathogens have been uncertain. O'Hanlon et al. used genomics on a panel of more than 200 isolates to trace the source of the frog pathogen B. dendrobatidis to a hyperdiverse hotspot in the Korean peninsula (see the Perspective by Lips). Over the past century, the trade in amphibian species has accelerated, and now all lineages of B. dendrobatidis occur in traded amphibians; the fungus has become ubiquitous and is diversifying rapidly.\nScience, this issue p. 621; see also p. 604\nGlobalized infectious diseases are causing species declines worldwide, but their source often remains elusive. We used whole-genome sequencing to solve the spatiotemporal origins of the most devastating panzootic to date, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a proximate driver of global amphibian declines. We traced the source of B. dendrobatidis to the Korean peninsula, where one lineage, BdASIA-1, exhibits the genetic hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the panzootic. We date the emergence of this pathogen to the early 20th century, coinciding with the global expansion of commercial trade in amphibians, and we show that intercontinental transmission is ongoing. Our findings point to East Asia as a geographic hotspot for B. dendrobatidis biodiversity and the original source of these lineages that now parasitize amphibians worldwide.\nThe chytrid fungus responsible for global amphibian declines originated in the Korean peninsula and spread during the past century by human trade.\nThe chytrid fungus responsible for global amphibian declines originated in the Korean peninsula and spread during the past century by human trade.",

            "abstractNote": "In this paper it is argued, using examples of disease emergence in aquatic animals in Europe, that the introduction of non-native species drives disease emergence by both extending the geographic range of parasites and pathogens and facilitating host-switching. Enteric red mouth disease and infectious haematopoietic necrosis of salmonids have extended their geographic range from North America to Europe with the import of live fish (Pimephales promelas) and rainbow trout eggs, respectively. Host-switching results in disease emergence when previously unidentified commensal organisms or known pathogen switch to new naïve hosts. The most serious endemic diseases of wild aquatic animals in Europe in recent years can be traced to the introduction of non-native species. Across Europe dramatic populations declines have occurred in native crayfish (e.g. Astacus astacus), oysters (Ostrea edulis) and eels (Anguilla anguilla), all which can be attributed, in varying degrees, to diseases (crayfish plague, Bonamia ostreae and Anguillicoloides crassus, respectively) introduced with non-native species. The severe adverse effects at a population level can be attributed to the lack of immunity in the new hosts. The impact of parasites more recently introduced to Europe, Sphaerothecum destruens (the rosette agent), and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, have yet to be fully determined. Both are generalists, with wide host ranges, and may present serious threats to native species. Aquaculture is the key driver for the introduction of non-native species. Most farming systems allow pathogen exchange between farmed and wild populations which underpins host-switching. Subsequently movements of animals between farms may result in the spread of newly emerged diseases. The introduction of non-native aquatic animals drives disease emergence, thus the ex-ante assessment of these hazards is severely limited. Generic risk mitigation measures (e.g. movement of disinfected eggs in place of live animals) and improved methods for rapid detection of new diseases are vital.",

The concept of species is old and has undergone several changes depending on the kind of organism(s). Earlier concepts were formulated considering mostly macroorganisms (plants or animals). In 21st century the microbial species concept took shape which changed from morphological, ecological, biological and phylogenetic to more agreeable polyphasic species concept. Polyphasic species concept involves a combination of characters such as morphology, physiology, biochemical markers and sequencing of various regions of the DNA known as molecular markers. There are also specific criteria such as DNA–DNA hybridization for complex genera of Bacteria and Archaea, extrolite profiling for complex genera of fungi, etc. Although species concept and taxonomy of Bacteria are more systematic than fungi, taxonomy in two domains (bacteria, archaea) and fungi of eukarya domain is undergoing changes. The time is not far when genome sequencing will be considered as another criterion for delineating species. This article also discusses the role of various techniques (MALDI, FAME, etc.) in species identification. The concept of Candidatus species and species annotation for metagenomic studies is also discussed. We briefly describe the criteria used to delineate species in various microbes and the need for different species concepts based on the kind of organism.",

            "abstractNote": "Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB) is a devastating invasive pest of potato both in its native North America and now across Eurasia. It also damages eggplant, tomato and feeds on several wild species in the Solanaceae, such as S. eleagnifolium and S. rostratum Dunal (SR). Since first categorized as a pest in 1864, CPB has spread rapidly across North America, Europe and Asia. In light of its invasiveness and economic importance, it is necessary to study how climate change and host availability may alter the distribution of the CPB. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models were used to anticipate global range expansion as influenced by environmental conditions, and by the possibility of cooperative invasion of CPB and its wild host SR. The results indicate that both CPB and SR can occupy warm areas of North America, South Africa, Europe, China, and Australia. Future climate conditions may promote CPB expansion into northern regions and SR into the circumpolar latitudes. The existing range and continued spread of SR may also assist the global expansion of CPB. Future management of this pest should consider the impacts of global climate change and host availability on its potential global distribution.",

            "abstractNote": "The East Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project of China (ESNT) uses the Grand Canal as the main pathway for water conveyance from the Yangtze River upstream to northern China and links five major lakes that serve as water storages along the route. The ESNT was completed in 2013. It was expanded from the existing Northern Jiangsu Water Transfer Project (NJWT), which had been in place since the 1960s. We observed invasions of two estuarine gobiids, Taenioides cirratus (Blyth, 1860) and Tridentiger bifasciatus (Steindachner, 1881), into the linked lakes. Taenioides cirratus was first reported in Luoma Lake in 2005 and Nansi Lake in 2011. Tridentiger bifasciatus was first observed in Luoma and Nansi lakes in 2015 and in Dongping Lake in 2016. Invasion of T. cirratus was probably associated with the operation of the NJWT, and then enhanced by operation of the ESNT. Invasion of T. bifasciatus was associated with operation of the ESNT. The ESNT/ NJWT is mainly operated during winter and spring when the Yangtze River is at the annual minimum discharge. Impoundment of reservoirs at the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries has dramatically reduced river discharge, which induces saltwater intrusion upstream to the donor area of the ESNT. Thus, estuarine gobiids can reach the donor region, and be dispersed upstream through water diversion. There are several other fish species in the Yangtze Estuary that have life history traits similar to these two gobiids and can also live in a wide range of salinities. It is important to evaluate their invasive risks in the future.",

Partindo da premissa que a presença de resíduos sólidos orgânicos e inorgânicos fornece substratos para refúgio e recursos alimentares para os caramujos contribuindo para a sua proliferação, o presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o consumo e a preferência de A. fulica por esses recursos. O estudo foi desenvolvido no Núcleo de Estudos do Comportamento Animal da Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná de 2002 a 2005 e constou da realização de seis experimentos para avaliar o consumo em diferentes classes de tamanho de caramujo, o consumo de hortaliças, plantas ornamentais e resíduos sólidos, expansão do horário de forrageamento e preferência alimentar. Foi constatada diferença de consumo nos diferentes tamanhos do animal e variação no consumo qualitativo e quantitativo dos itens oferecidos. A expansão do horário de forrageamento ocorreu apenas diante de alguns itens alimentares. O presente estudo evidenciou a utilização dos resíduos sólidos pelo caramujo-africano. Os dados servem como subsídio para ações de controle dessa espécie invasora.Palavras-chave: Dieta. Espécie invasora. Forrageamento. Paraná, Brasil.",

            "abstractNote": "The Yangtze River estuary is an important ecoregion. However, Spartina alterniflora, native to North America, was introduced to the estuary in the 1990s through both natural dispersal and humans and now it is a dominant species in the estuarine ecosystems, with its invasions leading to multiple consequences to the estuary. S. alterniflora had great competitive effects on native species, including Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis, and could potentially exclude the natives locally. The presence of S. alterniflora had little influence on the total density of soil nematodes and macrobenthonic invertebrates, but significantly altered the structure of trophic functional groups of nematode and macrobenthonic invertebrate communities. The conversion of mudflats to Spartina meadows had significant effects on birds of Charadriidae and Scolopacidae, which might be attributable to the reduction of food resources and the physical alterations of habitats for shorebirds. S. alterniflora invasions increased the primary productivity of the invaded ecosystems, and altered carbon and nitrogen cycling processes. Our studies focused mainly on the effects of S. alterniflora invasions on the structure of native ecosystems; thus further studies are clearly needed to investigate how ecosystem functioning is affected by the modification of the structure of estuarine ecosystems by S. alterniflora invasions.",

Besides a general overview of parasites of carp, swimbladder inflammation, caused by Sphaerospora spp., is discussed in detail. Saprolegnia spp. is the most important fungal pathogen. Aeromonas hydrophila and the atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Flexibacter columnaris, are described as the major bacterial pathogens of carp. Spring viraemia of carp caused by Rhabdovirus carpio is presented as the main viral infection of common carp. Details on methods of treatment and prevention are presented together with a description of the given diseases. The role of environmental stress, including “normal” culture practice and pollution, in the outbreak of diseases of common carp is discussed. Prospective methods to minimize the risk of diseases as well as their limitations are presented.",

Yet, few studies exist about potential hotspots of cacti invasion on a global scale. We used maximum entropy, boosted regression model and generalised additive models, calibrated using geo-referenced data from both the native and introduced ranges to construct ecological niche models for four invasive alien cacti species: Opuntia ficus-indica (the sweet prickly pear), Opuntia stricta (the sour prickly pear), Cylindropuntia imbricata (the tree cholla) and Cylindropuntia fulgida (the jumping cholla). The models were combined, using the average weighted method approach and projected onto the geographic space to predict terrestrial biomes, as well as areas of special conservation concern at risk of cacti invasion. The results indicate that the Mediterranean, tropical savanna and desert and xeric shrubland biomes are the most susceptible to cacti invasion. Eleven global biodiversity hotspots including the Mediterranean basin, Cape floristic region and Southwest Australia were associated with high risk of cacti invasion. The global maps of potential cacti distribution presented in this work have the potential to serve as an important contribution towards the implementation of a global policy to avoid the negative consequences of cacti invasion.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim Plant invasions often follow initial introduction with a considerable delay. The current non-native flora of a region may hence contain species that are not yet naturalized but may become so in the future, especially if climate change lifts limitations on species spread. In Europe, non-native garden plants represent a huge pool of potential future invaders. Here, we evaluate the naturalization risk from this species pool and how it may change under a warmer climate. Location Europe. Methods We selected all species naturalized anywhere in the world but not yet in Europe from the set of non-native European garden plants. For this subset of 783 species, we used species distribution models to assess their potential European ranges under different scenarios of climate change. Moreover, we defined geographical hotspots of naturalization risk from those species by combining projections of climatic suitability with maps of the area available for ornamental plant cultivation. Results Under current climate, 165 species would already find suitable conditions in >5% of Europe. Although climate change substantially increases the potential range of many species, there are also some that are predicted to lose climatically suitable area under a changing climate, particularly species native to boreal and Mediterranean biomes. Overall, hotspots of naturalization risk defined by climatic suitability alone, or by a combination of climatic suitability and appropriate land cover, are projected to increase by up to 102% or 64%, respectively. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the risk of naturalization of European garden plants will increase with warming climate, and thus it is very likely that the risk of negative impacts from invasion by these plants will also grow. It is therefore crucial to increase awareness of the possibility of biological invasions among horticulturalists, particularly in the face of a warming climate.",

            "abstractNote": "Global aquaculture relies heavily on the farming of non-native aquatic species (hereafter, NAS). NAS escapes from aquaculture facilities can result in serious aquatic bio-invasions, which has been an important issue in the FAO Blue Growth Initiative. A regulatory quagmire regarding NAS farming and escapes, however, exists in most developing countries. We discuss aquaculture expansion and NAS escapes, illustrate emerging risks and propose recommendations for improved aquaculture management across developing countries and particularly for China. In China, 68 NAS are known to have successfully established feral populations in natural habitats due to recurrent leakages or escapes; among the 68 NAS, 52 represent risks to native aquatic ecosystems. In addition to affecting a country's own biodiversity and ecosystem functions, NAS escapees can also threaten the biosecurity of shared waters in neighbouring countries. Policy implications. Non-native aquatic species (NAS) escapes have already had adverse ecological effects in China and other developing countries. The importance of this problem, however, is not adequately recognized by current conservation policies in developing countries. To conserve biodiversity and to support the goal of FAO's sustainable aquaculture, developing countries should now take responsible actions to address NAS escapes through policy and management improvements. Specifically, these countries should pass comprehensive legislation, establish effective agencies and national standards and planning and enhance integrated research and education to deal with risk assessment, prevention, monitoring and control of NAS escapes. Given that China is the world's largest aquacultural producer, China can create a model for other developing countries that will increase the biosecurity and sustainability of global aquaculture.",

Spartina species have contributed substantially (and continue contributing) to our knowledge in multiple disciplines, including ecology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, biogeography, experimental ecology, biological invasions, environmental management, restoration ecology, history, economics, and sociology. There is no rationale so compelling to subsume the name Spartina as a subgenus that could rival the striking, global iconic history and use of the name Spartina for over 200 yr. We do not agree with the subjective arguments underlying the proposal to change Spartina to Sporobolus. We understand the importance of both the objective phylogenetic insights and of the subjective formalized nomenclature and hope that by opening this debate we will encourage positive feedback that will strengthen taxonomic decisions with an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider that the strongly distinct, monophyletic clade Spartina should simply and efficiently be treated as the genus Spartina.",

            "abstractNote": "Termites are ubiquitous insects in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions and play an important role in ecosystems. Several termite species are also significant economic pests, mainly in urban areas where they attack human-­made structures, but also in natural forest habitats. Worldwide, approximately 28 termite species are considered invasive and have spread beyond their native ranges, often with significant economic consequences. We used predictive climate modeling to provide the first global risk assessment for 13 of the world’s most invasive termites. We modeled the future distribution of 13 of the most serious invasive termite species, using two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, and two projection years (2050 and 2070). Our results show that all but one termite species are expected to significantly increase in their global distribution, irrespective of the climatic scenario and year. The range shifts by species (shift vectors) revealed a complex pattern of distributional changes across latitudes rather than simple poleward expansion. Mapping of potential invasion hotspots in 2050 under the RCP 4.5 scenario revealed that the most suitable areas are located in the tropics. Substantial parts of all continents had suitable environmental conditions for more than four species simultaneously. Mapping of changes in the number of species revealed that areas that lose many species (e.g., parts of South America) are those that were previously very species-­rich, contrary to regions such as Europe that were overall not among the most important invasion hotspots, but that showed a great increase in the number of potential invaders. The substantial economic and ecological damage caused by invasive termites is likely to increase in response to climate change, increased urbanization, and accelerating economic globalization, acting singly or interactively.",

This insect has been reported in Benin as a major pest of maize causing important economic losses and putting at risk food and nutritional security. This study evaluated the damage caused by this pest to maize in different cropping system and management practices. It also assessed predatory ants presence and diversity and their potential in controlling FAW. Results showed that 50% of farmers grow maize in a mixed cropping systems in association with sorghum, cassava and cowpea and also used biopesticides. FAW larval population and damage in maize fields varied accros villages. Surprinsingly FAW larval population was higher in maize field sprayed with insecticides than untreated field. Seven species of predatory ants were recorded in maize field. Ants' population was higher in untreated field (1043 ants per hectare) than treated field (806 ants per hectare). In the laboratory, ants species exhibits great predatory potential. Further studies are needed to discuss uses of ants in FAW management in Benin. © 2021, African Association of Insect Scientists.",

Invasion (c. 15% Prosopis canopy cover) reduced grazing capacity by 34%, whereas clearing improved it by 110% within six years. Much of the loss in grazing capacity during invasion was due to the displacement of the annual grass Aristida adscensionis that dominated herbaceous forage production at the study site. Improvement in rangeland grazing capacity after Prosopis clearing was due to increases in abundance of A. adscensionis, the perennial grass Cynodon dactylon and the establishment of the perennial grasses Eragrostis obtusa and Eragrostis lehmanniana. Grazing capacity in cleared rangeland was 39% higher than in uninvaded rangeland due to a higher abundance of the annual grasses A. adscensionis, Chloris virgata, Setaria verticillata and Tragus berteronianus and the perennial grasses E. obtusa, E. lehmanniana and C. dactylon. Our results indicate that Prosopis invasion (>13% mean canopy cover) can lower grazing capacity in Nama Karoo rangeland, whereas clearing Prosopis from such rangeland can, even under heavy grazing, substantially improve grazing capacity within 4–6 years.",

            "abstractNote": "Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing food-producing sector and currently the main source of fish supply. However, environmental sustainability is one of the main challenges faced by the industry, in particular the inevitable occurrence of fish escapes, which are considered a major threat to marine ecosystems. Here we evaluated the risks associated with the impacts of introducing non-native species, the genetic introgression of farmed fish into wild stocks and the spread of pathogens and parasites through escapes of farmed fish at a global scale. Our analysis indicated that a nearly a third of marine ecoregions of the world are to some extent at risk from the impacts of fish escapes. We estimated that 26.5% of global production comprises non-native species, equating 1.74 million tonnes per year, with the Magellanic province in Southern Chile being a hotspot for ecological invasion impacts, owing to a large production of non-native salmonids. Genetic risk hotspots were also identified in East China and Yellow Sea, which support the world's largest and more diverse production of native fish. The combination of high pathogen diversity and production levels recorded for East China and the Mediterranean Sea resulted in the highest pathogenic risk predicted for these provinces. When considering the combined risk of these three stressors the warm temperate Northwest Pacific ranked highest in terms of overall risks. We highlight the need of preventive and mitigation measures to reduce fish escapes, particularly in sensitive ecoregions, considering risk assessment for farming non-native species and the critical role of policy makers in implementing these measures to allow the sustainable development of aquaculture.",

            "abstractNote": "Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a crop pest native to the Americas, which has invaded and spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa within two years. Recent estimates of 20-50% maize yield loss in Africa suggest severe impact on livelihoods. Fall armyworm is still infilling its potential range in Africa and could spread to other continents. In order to understand fall armyworm's year-round, global, potential distribution, we used evidence of the effects of temperature and precipitation on fall armyworm life-history, combined with data on native and African distributions to construct Species Distribution Models (SDMs). We also investigated the strength of trade and transportation pathways that could carry fall armyworm beyond Africa. Up till now, fall armyworm has only invaded areas that have a climate similar to the native distribution, validating the use of climatic SDMs. The strongest climatic limits on fall armyworm's year-round distribution are the coldest annual temperature and the amount of rain in the wet season. Much of sub-Saharan Africa can host year-round fall armyworm populations, but the likelihoods of colonising North Africa and seasonal migrations into Europe arc hard to predict. South and Southeast Asia and Australia have climate conditions that would permit fall armyworm to invade. Current trade and transportation routes reveal Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand face high threat of fall armyworm invasions originating from Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "Theory predicts that native plant species should exhibit latitudinal gradients in the strength of their interactions with herbivores. We hypothesize that if an invasive plant species exhibits a different latitudinal gradient in response to herbivores (e.g., a nonparallel gradient), it can create large-scale heterogeneities in community resistance/susceptibility to the invasive species. We conducted a study of latitudinal variation in the strength of herbivory and defenses of native genotypes of Phragmites australis in North America (NA) and Europe (EU) and European invasive genotypes in NA. Within NA, we tested whether (1) invasive genotypes are better defended and suffer less herbivory than co-occurring native genotypes, (2) herbivory and defenses of native P. australis decreases with increasing latitude; and (3) invasive genotypes exhibit either no latitudinal gradient, or a nonparallel latitudinal gradient in herbivory and defenses compared to native genotypes. For the European genotypes, we tested two additional hypotheses: (4) defenses, nutritional condition, and herbivory would differ between the native (EU) and invasive ranges (NA) and (5) latitudinal gradients in defenses and herbivory would be similar between ranges. Within NA, chewing damage, internal stemfeeding incidence, and aphid abundance were 650%, 300%, and 70% lower, respectively, on invasive than native P. australis genotypes. Genotypes in NA also differed in nutritional condition (percent N, C:N ratio), but there was little support for invasive genotypes being better defended than native genotypes. For the European genotypes, herbivory was significantly lower in the invaded than native range, supporting the enemy-release hypothesis. Defense levels (leaf toughness and total phenolics) and tissue percent C and percent N were higher in the invaded than native range for European genotypes. Overall, latitudinal gradients in P. australis nutritional condition, defenses, and herbivory were common. Interestingly, chewing damage and stem-feeder incidence decreased with latitude for native P. australis genotypes in NA and EU, but no latitudinal gradients in response to herbivores were evident for invasive genotypes in NA. Nonparallel latitudinal gradients in herbivory between invasive and native P. australis suggest that the community may be more susceptible to invasion at lower than at higher latitudes. Our study points to the need for invasion biology to include a biogeographic perspective.",

The assumption that remote regions remain pristine plays a key role in directing policies for regional environmental management and conservation, and affects the local and global financial impetus to do so. In this paper, we use Argentinean Patagonia and the SW Atlantic as examples to argue that the assumption ‘remote region = pristine region’ is unjustified and based on a lack of information rather than on scientific evidence. We also discuss the major existing environmental threats to this supposedly ‘pristine’ region, and use emblematic examples to provide a more realistic picture of the regional environmental integrity and to set recommendations directed to improve environmental management and conservation within this context.",

Three variables have been considered to assess their negative ecological impacts when these species escape from aquaculture facilities: (i) their distribution across Europe (including non-EU Member States); (ii) evidence of their environmental impact in the wild; and (iii) evidence of their being vectors of non-target alien species and other hitchhikers (e.g. pathogens). Drivers of use and mechanisms of dispersal in the wild have been also considered and reviewed. Twenty of the species are freshwater fishes: alien cyprinids and salmonids have been introduced into Europe mainly for food production, sport fishing and ornamental purposes. The most widespread species are the goldfish Carassius auratus and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, established in 29 and 28 European countries, respectively. Notwithstanding their successful distribution in Europe, only the Gibel carp Carassius gibelio and the peneid shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus were found to have environmental impact in all the countries of establishment. Crayfish and predatory fishes (e.g. catfishes and salmonids) cause major environmental impacts in Europe by outcompeting native species and altering habitat structure. Alien crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, are responsible for the largest range of impacts (i.e. crayfish plague dissemination, bioaccumulation of pollutants, community dominance, competition and predation on native species, habitat modifications, food web impairment, herbivory and macrophytes removal). Cyprinids (e.g. herbivorous carps) are vectors of diseases and parasites, while salmonids (e.g. Salvelinus fontinalis) often cause genetic impairment of native stocks by hybridization. The importation of alien farmed (target) species frequently leads to the introduction of associated non-target species. The cultures of the Pacific cupped oyster Crassostrea gigas and Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum were responsible for the introduction of the largest number (60) of non-native invertebrates and algae, often attached to packaging material, fouling the shell or parasitizing bivalve tissues.",

            "abstractNote": "Fish provides 15% of the total animal protein in human diets. It is also the primary source of livelihood for 35 million people (30 M in Asia and 2.6 M in Africa). The increase in global population and demand for fish protein cannot be met by capture fisheries alone. Governments are turning towards aquaculture as the source of fish protein. However, it has also led to the introduction and establishment of non-native species in local ecosystems through their escapement from aquaculture facilities to the wild. In freshwater ecosystems with relatively high endemism, this has become a significant problem. Documenting the international movement of fish is one way of providing a general view of the magnitude of these movements and the existing and potential threat faced by ecosystems due to species invasiveness. Information, however, is limited and scattered in different journals and agency/project reports. Several agencies, both local and international, have databases that provide information on invasive species (terrestrial and aquatic, local, regional or international in scope). The critical challenge is for consolidation, common access through data sharing and development of risk assessment and management tools. This is proposed through the use of Internet technology, sharing of databases or having a gateway or portal to which all introduced and invasive fish species related databases link. The fusion of these information sources will allow access to updated and reliable information. The experience of the WorldFish Center in documenting these phenomena through developing the FishBase information system and global partnerships is presented with recommendations for harmonizing approaches.",

            "abstractNote": "Coastal and regional sea ecosystems suffer from several human-induced stressors, including human mediated bioinvasions. The Baltic Sea is generally considered to be susceptible to invasions by non-indigenous species (NIS). Out of the total of 132 NIS and cryptogenic species recorded, 59% are currently established in at least one country surrounding the Baltic Sea. On average, each country currently hosts 27 such species with 15% of the established species being found in at least 50% of the countries. Benthic macroinvertebrates dominate, both among those recorded (48%) and established (59%) species. Shipping, deliberate stocking and natural spread of NIS previously introduced to the North Sea are the main introduction pathways, with considerable dynamics over time. Amongst the pathways responsible for the currently established species, shipping and natural spread strongly dominate. Substantial uncertainty in the information on introduction pathways (except for deliberate releases) hampers detailed analyses and poses major challenges for management. Spatio-temporal variability in the invasion dynamics reflects both the spatial differences in the main hydrographic conditions of the Baltic Sea as well as the availability of introduction pathways. We conclude that the Baltic Sea cannot be considered as a uniform waterbody in terms of the established introduced species and at least two major regions with differing hydrographic conditions and introduction pathways can be clearly distinguished. Due to the importance of natural spread of NIS from the North Sea, regional cooperation in bioinvasion management should be enhanced in the future.",

Using a synthesis of nonindigenous species (NIS) occurrences in North America, we characterized the invasion history for coastal marine ecosystems by invertebrates and algae through 2010, to evaluate variation and existing patterns at a continental scale. This study updates a previous analysis of invasions for the same taxonomic groups in North America, providing a first assessment of changes in the last 11 year period (2000–2010). Overall, we documented 450 marine and estuarine NIS that are considered to have established populations in tidal waters of North America, representing a 51% increase in NIS richness compared to the earlier analysis. Of the 152 species added, 71 species (47%) have first documented records since the year 1999, and 81 species (53%) were additions attributed to earlier time periods due to recent reports and further analysis. Across all time periods, taxonomic groups with the largest contribution were Crustaceans (112 species) and Molluscs (80 species), together providing 43% of the total species richness for North America. Species richness was unevenly distributed among coasts, with most documented on the Pacific Coast (310 species) and fewer on the Atlantic Coast (189 species) and Gulf Coast (88 species). Commercial ships have contributed between (a) 44–78% of the initial (primary) invasions of all nonindigenous species to North America and (b) 52–82% of NIS in the last 30-year time interval, being driven by transfers associated with ballast water and hull biofouling. Importantly, invasion dynamics are a shifting landscape, where the past may not predict the future, especially with emerging trade patterns and global to local environmental changes. Thus, effective management to reduce future invasions requires a dynamic and multi-vector approach, instead of single vector strategies based on past history alone.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim: For over 80 years, the Maine baitworm trade has shipped live polychaete worms and packing algae 'wormweed' to distributors world-wide, while also consistently transferring a wide diversity and abundance of hitchhiking organisms of all life stages to numerous recipient communities. Here, we investigate this potent, yet underestimated, invasion vector using an important recipient region (the Mid-Atlantic) to examine the stepwise species transfer and survival along four stages of the vector. Location: Maine and Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina), USA. Methods: We quantified taxonomic identities and abundances of organisms associated with packing algae at four stages along the vector pathway during summer 2011: (1) Maine source habitats; (2) bait boxes from Maine distributors; (3) bait boxes from distributors in five Mid-Atlantic States; and (4) bait bags from retailers in five Mid-Atlantic States. We also examined functional diversity based on significant physical and life history characteristics and assessed genetic diversity for two common hitchhiking snail species. Results: We identified 17,798 live macro-organisms across 58 taxa, including marine macro-invertebrates, macroalgae, vascular plants and semi-terrestrial or aquatic invertebrates, present in bait boxes and bags. In all measures of diversity and abundance, we observed decreases of live marine macro-invertebrates across sequential stages of the vector from source to recipient regions. Significant differences in community composition were also observed between stages and were driven by isopods (taxonomic diversity) and isopods, amphipods and some gastropods (functional diversity). Main conclusions: The lack of management in the face of the sheer magnitude and diversity of organisms that are transported via the live marine bait trade underscores how this is an underappreciated vector that could be a considerable source of successful invasions globally.",

            "abstractNote": "Confusion between terms and ambiguities among definitions have long plagued the field of invasion biology. One result is disruption in flow of information from researchers to policy-makers and managers who rely on science to inform regulatory frameworks and management actions. We reviewed the South African marine biology literature to quantify the current usage of terminology describing marine invasions and found a variety of terms in use, few of which are defined when used. In response, we propose standard terminology that aligns with international practice. We then interpreted the Blackburn unified framework for biological invasions within the marine context and used this as a transparent way to apply the standardised terms to an updated list of marine alien species for the country. This resulted in the recognition of 36 alien and 53 invasive species within South Africa. Most notably, follow-up research is required to confirm the status of at least 11 listed species, the majority of which have been recorded only once, or not in the past 25 years. It is hoped that by standardising terminology, marine science in South Africa will better support authorities charged with managing the threat posed by marine alien species.",

The utility and potential sources of bias within four complementary sources of data on non-indigenous marine species in New Zealand are also evaluated. These were: (i) the national port biological baseline surveys (PBBS), (ii) the Marine High Risk Site Surveillance (MHRSS), (iii) the Marine Invasives Taxonomic Service (MITS) and (iv) synthetic reviews of non-indigenous and cryptogenic marine species in New Zealand. Eight non-indigenous species were proposed for consideration as ‘key species' for reporting statistics on range expansion/decrease and change in abundance/prevalence, based on their impacts on native ecosystems, rate of population expansion, and the accuracy of data collected on them within New Zealand: (1) Asian bag mussel, Arcuatula senhousia, (2) Asian paddle crab, Charybdis japonica, (3) Australian droplet tunicate, Eudistoma elongatum, (4) Green tail or ‘Greasy-back' prawn, Metapenaeus bennettae, (5) Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii, (6) Clubbed tunicate, Styela clava, (7) Fragile clam, Theora (Endopluera) lubrica, (8) Wakame / Undaria, Undaria pinnatifida. They encompass a range of life habits, taxonomic and trophic groups, and occur in a variety of different marine environments within New Zealand. Based on the outcome of the review, four statistics were recommended for reporting on the national‘Marine pests' indicator: Indicators of non-indigenous species in marine systems (i) The total number of documented non-indigenous marine species in 2009, (ii) The annual (post 2009) number of non-indigenous species that are new-to-New Zealand. (iii) The maximum latitudinal extent of each of the ‘key species', (iv) The number and distribution of geographic units that each key species has been recorded from within the MHRSS locations (‘occupancy'). Data from the PBBS, MHRSS, MITS and synthetic reviews were used to quantify each statistic and to evaluate their fitness-for-purpose relative to each of five criteria used by the Ministry to assess data quality.",

            "abstractNote": "The past subsistence of the Lake Victoria fishery was dominated by rich, diverse haplochromine cichlids. This multispecies fishery has undergone a decline over the past four decades, evolving into a commercial fishery consisting mainly of Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea species). To better understand Lake Victoria fisheries, studies dating as far back as the 1920s have been carried out to assess the status of the fish stocks. These past studies indicated the lake fisheries were declining because of numerous major challenges, including intense fishing, invasive species, loss of biodiversity, ecological alterations, climate change, inadequate information to inform management and unharmonized policies. Numerous policies and regulations have been developed and implemented over the years to address these issues and manage the fisheries sustainably. Most of the interventions have been sectorial, disjointed and unharmonized and have not reduced the declining fish catch rates. With reestablishment of the East Africa Community (EAC) with several institutions in 1994, the Lake Victoria riparian states initiated an ecosystem approach to manage the Lake Victoria fishery resources in a sustainable manner. This study reviews the development of the Lake Victoria fisheries, outlines major past and present management challenges and provides a set of new strategies to manage the lake’s fisheries resources, with emphasis on an ecosystem approach.",

Sites invaded by P. juliflora had different ligneous plant composition with lower order seral species being dominant. In all landuses, Prosopis-invaded sites had more species richness, diversity, and evenness. However, increase in species richness was due to occurrence of more weedy species along with Prosopis juliflora. Even amongst the protected and undisturbed sites, dominance of late successional species, e.g., Acacia senegal, Maytenus emarginata, Ziziphus nummularia and Acacia nilotica, was less at sites with Prosopis juliflora than at sites without it. Density of Commiphora wightii, an endangered species, decreased with increasing density of P. juliflora. Invasion of P. juliflora has thus demonstrable adverse impacts on plant communities in arid grazing lands.",

Here we set out to assess the economic value of dry land ecosystem services aﬀected by the invasive tree Prosopis, which was originally introduced in Africa and elsewhere for providing ﬁrewood, animal fodder and other services to rural people. Based on choice experiment method, we estimated the economic values of dry land ecosystem services aﬀected by Prosopis in the heavily invaded Afar region, Ethiopia and Baringo County, Kenya. Including labor and cash contributions as payment attributes, a random parameters logit model was employed for analyzing households' preferences for the aﬀected ecosystem services. We found that, despite the services provided by Prosopis, households from both regions were willing to pay for its management primarily driven by biodiversity and water. WTP was on average higher in Afar (USD 50.42/year) than in Baringo (USD 37.74/year), which may be because the ecosystems in Afar were less degraded prior to the invasion by Prosopis than in Baringo and that charcoal production in Afar is oﬃcially prohibited. Our results indicate that the costs imposed by the deliberately introduced Prosopis outweigh its beneﬁts in both Afar and Baringo.",

To determine the abundance and distribution of such exotic salmon populations in the wild and their effect on native organisms, we conducted experimental ﬁshing, in six locations in the salmon farming regions (41Њ–46Њ S) in the inner seas of Chiloe´ (X Region) and Aysen (XI Region), between November 1995 and December 1996. At the same time, we collected information from salmon farms and insurance companies about escaped individuals. During the experimental ﬁshing we captured 2602 coho salmon, 984 trout, and 271 Atlantic salmon. Captures of the three species declined through the duration of the study; thus in November 1996 we captured Ͻ10% of initial catches. Population projections based on three possible mortality rates (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2) predicted the disappearance of salmon by year 2000, and the highest mortality rate was the best predictor of the observed available biomass in 1996. Thus, artisanal ﬁshing may control escaped salmon. Of the three species, coho salmon had the best chances of becoming established in the remote XI Region where the artisanal ﬁshing pressure was less intense.",

Yet, such ‘improved fallows’ have not been widely adopted, in part due to the costs of labour and seedlings. In some situations, however, farmers have developed novel approaches to agroforestry fallows by taking advantage of spontaneous invasions of woody leguminous tree species present in the vicinity of their fields. In this paper, we examine cases from Réunion, highland Madagascar, the Bateke plateau in Congo, and the Palni hills of southern India where farmers have adapted their cultivation practices to take advantage of the invasive characteristics of Australian acacias that were introduced earlier for other reasons. We focus on the key social, economic, and environmental factors that influence farmers in these places to gain opportunistic benefit from these introduced tree species that biologists have been deemed invasive and damaging to local ecosystems and biodiversity. We conclude that opportunistic fallowing of invasives can be viewed as a hybrid strategy combining elements of natural fallows and improved fallows—which we call ‘hybrid improved fallows’—in that it takes advantage of the ‘weedy’ characteristics of introduced leguminous tree species in the landscape and offers a cost-effective and pragmatic strategy for soil and vegetation management for farmers.",

Rainbow and brown trout have successfully established reproducing populations in Japan, and especially expanding their distribution in Hokkaido. Brook trout have shown relatively limited invasion in some spring-fed streams and ponds both in Honshu and Hokkaido. The introduced exotic trout have been implicated in reducing populations of native fishes, especially stream salmonids, through predation, competitive interaction for resources, and interspecific hybridization. Monitoring, management, including eradication, and evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures should be carried out to contain the ecological risks of trout invasion.",

However, relatively little information exists about non-native marine species in China. This study provides an inventory of non-native marine and coastal species (213 species) reported to date in China (including the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea). The main source regions were the Atlantic, Pacific, Indo-Pacific, and Indian Oceans (196 species in total, or 92.0% of species). Over one-third of non-native marine species (74 species) have established self-sustaining populations, and nearly half of the non-native species (93 species) caused negative ecological and economic impacts. The main introduction pathways of the known non-native species are ornamental trade (74 species, 34.7%), followed by aquaculture (69 species, 32.4%), shipping (65 species, 30.5%), and ecological restoration (5 species, 2.3%). The number of non-native marine species is higher in the northern sea than that in the southern sea of China. Non-native marine species have caused significant positive and negative impacts on China’s environment and economy. Clearly, future studies need to focus on detecting and managing non-native marine species in China.",
