            "abstractNote": "The influence of life history traits on the dispersal of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi is reviewed. Spores are liberated from aboveground (epigeous) sporocarps through either ballistosporic discharge down to the ground (Basidiomycota) or bursting of asci up into the air (Ascomycota). Recent studies have shown that many spores fall close to the source sporocarp, increasing the probability of germinants coming into contact with compatible host roots and mating types but also potential competitors. Spores of both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are also transported via wind, becoming increasingly diffuse with distance. Ascospores can establish new individuals from single spores as homokaryons, but a diffuse spore rain can reduce the chance for establishing dikaryons in new locations for Basidiomycota. Spores dispersed via mycophagist animals (hypogeous fungi, but also epigeous fungi such as Suillus) are transported to new locations in fecal material that can contain millions of spores and abundant compatible mating types. A few species in Suillus and Laccaria/Hydnagium are known to produce dikaryotic spores that can establish new individuals from single spores. Some species produce dormant sexual spores (Rhizopogon) or asexual chlamydospores (Wilcoxina) and sclerotia (Cenococcum). These propagules can build up over time as a resistant propagule bank in soils. Fungi that produce dormant propagules contribute to EcM success in early successional settings and help these fungi coinvade new locations with their hosts.",

Predictions for leaf CO2 assimilation (A(net)) generally fit our understanding of limitations to photosynthesis, and the FACE experiments indicate concurrent enhancement of photosynthesis and of partial downregulation. In addition, most herbaceous species had reduced leaf nitrogen (N)-content under elevated [CO2] and thus only a modest enhancement of A(net), whereas most woody species had little change in leaf N with elevated [CO2] but a larger enhancement of A(net). Early predictions for primary production are more mixed. Predictions that enhancement of productivity would be greater in drier ecosystems or in drier years has only limited support. Furthermore, differences in productivity enhancements among six plant functional types were not significant. By contrast, increases in productivity enhancements with increased N availability are well supported by the FACE results. Thus, neither a resource-based conceptual model nor a plant functional type conceptual model is exclusively supported by FACE results, but rather both species identity and resource availability are important factors influencing the response of ecosystems to elevated [CO2].",

Fifteen months after the fire, burnt areas had about half the basal area of living trees and more than twice the cover of Buffel Grass and Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) as unburnt areas. This is consistent with the idea that Buffel Grass invasion, which increases ground fuel loads in Acacia woodlands, is facilitated by burning, producing positive feedback between Buffel Grass and fire. The result is accelerating remnant degradation, making the interaction between Buffel Grass and fire an important target for management measures. Fire-breaks and fuel reduction strategies including periodic intense grazing and canopy enhancement have potential to reduce the impact of Buffel Grass invasion, but long-term community survival will probably require effective control of Buffel Grass. The impact of weed invasion within remnant vegetation is clearly a complex issue but the simple ‘case study’ approach employed here can both increase and communicate understanding.",

            "abstractNote": "Globally, species distributions are shifting in response to environmental change,1 and those that cannot disperse risk extinction.2 Many taxa, including marine species, are showing poleward range shifts as the climate warms.3 In the Southern Hemisphere, however, circumpolar oceanic fronts can present barriers to dispersal.4 Although passive, southward movement of species across this barrier has been considered unlikely,5,6 the recent discovery of buoyant kelp rafts on beaches in Antarctica7,8 demonstrates that such journeys are possible. Rafting is a key process by which diverse taxa—including terrestrial, e.g., Lindo,9 Godinot,10 and Censky et al.,11 and marine, e.g., Carlton et al.12 and Gillespie et al.13 species—can cross oceans.14 Kelp rafts can carry passengers7,15, 16, 17 and thus can act as vectors for long-distance dispersal of coastal organisms. The small numbers of kelp rafts previously found in Antarctica7,8 do not, however, shed much light on the frequency of such dispersal events.18 We use a combination of high-resolution phylogenomic analyses (>220,000 SNPs) and oceanographic modeling to show that long-distance biological dispersal events in Southern Ocean are not rare. We document tens of kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) rafting events of thousands of kilometers each, over several decades (1950–2019), with many kelp rafts apparently still reproductively viable. Modeling of dispersal trajectories from genomically inferred source locations shows that distant landmasses are well connected, for example South Georgia and New Zealand, and the Kerguelen Islands and Tasmania. Our findings illustrate the power of genomic approaches to track, and modeling to show frequencies of, long-distance dispersal events.",

Native crayfishes also preferred exotic over native plants when tested across 57 native and 15 exotic plants found growing sympatrically at 11 sites throughout the southeastern USA. Exotic grass carp that share little evolutionary history with most of these plants exhibited no preference for native vs. exotic species. Analyses of three terrestrial data sets showed similar patterns, with native herbivores generally preferring exotic plants, while exotic herbivores rarely exhibited a preference. Thus, exotic plants may escape their coevolved herbivores only to be preferentially consumed by the native generalist herbivores in their new ranges, suggesting that native herbivores may provide biotic resistance to plant invasions.",

The interpretation of these results has been disputed recently and it was proposed that sampling effects were responsible for the observed decrease of invasibility with diversity. The experiments performed to date were not designed to adequately separate sampling from diversity effects. Using the establishment of native plant species in experimental plant communities as a model of invasibility, we show that the number of invaders decreased with increasing diversity. When the presence of particular species is included, their effects are dominant. Centaurea jacea showed a strong effect at low diversity, whereas Leucanthemum vulgare showed a very strong negative impact at each diversity level. The negative effect of the latter might be related to root-feeding nematodes that showed far higher abundance in plots with Leucanthemum. However, diversity remained a significant factor in determining the number of invading species and the numbers of an abundant invader.",

            "abstractNote": "Biotic resistance and disturbance are fundamental processes influencing plant invasion outcomes; however, the role of consumers in regulating the establishment and spread of plant invaders and how disturbance modifies biotic resistance by consumers is unclear. We document that fire in combination with experimental exclusion of rodent consumers shifted a native desert shrubland to a low-diversity, invasive annual grassland dominated by Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). In contrast, burned plots with rodents present suppressed invasion by cheatgrass and developed into a more diverse forb community. Rodents created strong biotic resistance to the establishment of aggressive plant invaders likely through seed and seedling predation, which had cascading effects on plant competition and plant community diversity. Fire mediated its positive effects on plant invaders through native plant removal and by decreasing the abundance and diversity of the rodent community. The experimental disruption of plant and consumer-mediated biotic resistance of plant invaders using fire and rodent exclusion treatments provides strong evidence that native plants and rodents are important regulators of plant invasion dynamics and plant biodiversity in our study system. While rodents conferred strong resistance to invasion in our study system, fluctuations in rodent populations due to disturbance and climatic events may provide windows of opportunity for exotic plant species to escape biotic resistance by rodent consumers and initiate invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "Many introduced plant species rely on mutualisms in their new habitats to overcome barriers to establishment and to become naturalized and, in some cases, invasive. Mutualisms involving animalmediated pollination and seed dispersal, and symbioses between plant roots and microbiota often facilitate invasions. The spread of many alien plants, particularly woody ones, depends on pollinator mutualisms. Most alien plants are well served by generalist pollinators (insects and birds), and pollinator limitation does not appear to be a major barrier for the spread of introduced plants (special conditions relating to Ficus and orchids are described). Seeds of many of the most notorious plant invaders are dispersed by animals, mainly birds and mammals. Our review supports the view that tightly coevolved, plant-vertebrate seed dispersal systems are extremely rare. Vertebrate-dispersed plants are generally not limited reproductively by the lack of dispersers. Most mycorrhizal plants form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which, because of their low speciﬁcity, do not seem to play a major role in facilitating or hindering plant invasions (except possibly on remote islands such as the Galapagos which are poor in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). The lack of symbionts has, however, been a major barrier for many ectomycorrhizal plants, notably for Pinus spp. in parts of the southern hemisphere. The roles of nitrogen-ﬁxing associations between legumes and rhizobia and between actinorhizal plants and Frankia spp. in promoting or hindering invasions have been virtually ignored in the invasions literature. Symbionts required to induce nitrogen ﬁxation in many plants are extremely widespread, but intentional introductions of symbionts have altered the invasibility of many, if not most, systems. Some of the world’s worst invasive alien species only invaded after the introduction of symbionts. Mutualisms in the new environment sometimes re-unite the same species that form partnerships in the native range of the plant. Very often, however, diﬀerent species are involved, emphasizing the diﬀuse nature of many (most) mutualisms. Mutualisms in new habitats usually duplicate functions or strategies that exist in the natural range of the plant. Occasionally, mutualisms forge totally novel combinations, with profound implications for the behaviour of the introduced plant in the new environment (examples are seed dispersal mutualisms involving wind-dispersed pines and cockatoos in Australia ; and mycorrhizal associations involving plant roots and fungi). Many ecosystems are becoming more susceptible to invasion by introduced plants because : (a) they contain an increasing array of potential mutualistic partners (e.g. generalist frugivores and pollinators, mycorrhizal fungi with wide host ranges, rhizobia strains with infectivity across genera) ; and (b) conditions conducive for the establishment of various alien\\alien synergisms are becoming more abundant. Incorporating perspectives on mutualisms in screening protocols will improve (but not perfect) our ability to predict whether a given plant species could invade a particular habitat.",

Here, we summarize the environmental effects of climate change and illustrate the ecological responses of freshwater fishes to these effects, spanning individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Climate change is modifying hydrological cycles across atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic components of subarctic ecosystems, causing increases in ambient water temperature and nutrient availability. These changes affect the individual behavior, habitat use, growth and metabolism, alter population spawning and recruitment dynamics, leading to changes in species abundance and distribution, modify food web structure, trophic interactions and energy flow within communities and change the sources, quantity and quality of energy and nutrients in ecosystems. Increases in temperature and its variability in aquatic environments underpin many ecological responses; however, altered hydrological regimes, increasing nutrient inputs and shortened ice cover are also important drivers of climate change effects and likely contribute to context-dependent responses. Species invasions are a complex aspect of the ecology of climate change because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect and a driver of the ecological consequences of climate change. Using subarctic freshwaters as an example, we illustrate how climate change can alter three distinct aspects of species invasions: (1) the vulnerability of ecosystems to be invaded, (2) the potential for species to spread and invade new habitats, and (3) the subsequent ecological effects of invaders. We identify three fundamental knowledge gaps focused on the need to determine (1) how environmental and landscape characteristics influence the ecological impact of climate change, (2) the separate and combined effects of climate and non-native invading species and (3) the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms responsible for changes in patterns of biodiversity.",

Although there is a fossil record of species invasions occurring in waves after geographic barriers had been lifted, such episodic events differ markedly from human-assisted invasions in spatial and temporal scales and in the number and diversity of organisms involved in long-distance dispersal. Today, every region of the planet is simultaneously affected and modern rates of invasion are several orders of magnitude higher than prehistoric rates. In terms of its rate and geographical extent, its potential for synergistic disruption and the scope of its evolutionary consequences, the current mass invasion event is without precedent and should be regarded as a unique form of global change. Prehistoric examples of biotic interchanges are nonetheless instructive and can increase our understanding of species-area effects, evolutionary effects, biotic resistance to invasion, and the impacts of novel functional groups introduced to naïve biotas. Nevertheless, they provide only limited insight into the synergistic effects of invasions and other environmental stressors, the effect of frequent introductions of large numbers of propagules, and global homogenization, all of which characterize the current mass invasion event.",

Here we assess whether the invasion of exotic plants – mostly mediated by habitat disturbance – facilitates the invasion of exotic flower visitors in temperate forests of the southern Andes, Argentina. We recorded visit frequencies and the identity of visitors to the flowers of 15 native and 15 exotic plant species occurring in different highly disturbed and less disturbed habitats. We identified three alien flower visitors, the hymenopterans Apis mellifera, Bombus ruderatus, and Vespula germanica. We found significantly more visitation by exotic insects in disturbed habitats. This pattern was explained, at least in part, by the association between alien flower visitors and flowers of exotic plants, which occurred more frequently in disturbed habitats. However, this general pattern masked different responses between the two main alien flower visitors. Apis mellifera exploited almost exclusively the flowers of a subset of herbaceous exotic plants that thrive under disturbance, whereas B. ruderatus visited equally flowers of both exotic and native plants in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We did not find any strong evidence that flowers of exotic plants were more generalist than those of native plants, or that exotic flower visitors were more generalist than their native counterparts. Our results suggest that alien plant species could facilitate the invasion of at least some exotic flower visitors to disturbed habitats. Because flowering plants as well as flower visitors benefit from this mutualism, this association may enhance, through a positive feedback, successful establishment of both exotic partners.",

Here we show invasion by the alien crazy\nant Anoplolepis gracilipes causes a rapid, catastrophic shift in the rain forest ecosystem of a\ntropical oceanic island, affecting at least three trophic levels. In invaded areas, crazy ants\nextirpate the red land crab, the dominant endemic consumer on the forest floor. In doing\nso, crazy ants indirectly release seedling recruitment, enhance species richness of seedlings,\nand slow litter breakdown. In the forest canopy, new associations between this invasive ant\nand honeydew-secreting scale insects accelerate and diversify impacts. Sustained high\ndensities of foraging ants on canopy trees result in high population densities of hostgeneralist\nscale insects and growth of sooty moulds, leading to canopy dieback and even\ndeaths of canopy trees. The indirect fallout from the displacement of a native  keystone \nspecies by an ant invader, itself abetted by introduced/cryptogenic mutualists, produces\nsynergism in impacts to precipitate invasional  meltdown  in this system.",

More recently, positive interactions drew attention from community assembly theory and invasion science. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) introduced the idea that positive interactions among non-native species could facilitate one another’s invasion, even increasing their impact upon the native community. Many studies have addressed IMH, but with contrasting results, reflecting various types of evidence on a multitude of scales. Here we use the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach to differentiate key aspects of IMH, organizing and linking empirical studies to sub-hypotheses of IMH. We also assess the level of empirical support for each sub-hypothesis based on the evidence reported in the studies. We identified 150 studies addressing IMH. The majority of studies support IMH, but the evidence comes from studies with different aims and questions. Supporting studies at the community or ecosystem level are currently rare. Evidence is scarce for marine habitats and vertebrates. Few sub-hypotheses are questioned by more than 50% of the evaluated studies, indicating that non-native species do not affect each other’s survival, growth, reproduction, abundance, density or biomass in reciprocal A ↔ B interactions. With the HoH for IMH presented here, we can monitor progress in empirical tests and evidences of IMH. For instance, more tests at the community and ecosystem level are needed, as these are necessary to address the core of this hypothesis.",

Nothofagus had a species-rich (98 species) fungal community dominated by native Cortinarius and two cosmopolitan fungi. • These results support co-invasion by mutualists rather than novel associations as an important mechanism by which plants avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, consistent with invasional meltdown.",

The intensity of flooding in wetland areas will thus increase, with corresponding impacts on soil properties and coastal ecosystems. We studied the impacts of two levels of water inundation on the concentration and stoichiometry of soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur in areas dominated by the native C3 species Scirpus triqueter L., the native C4 species Cyperus malaccensis var. brevifolius Boecklr. and the invasive Gramineae C3 species Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud in the Shanyutan wetland areas of the Minjiang River estuary in China. Comparison of the communities dominated by these three species in high- and low-water flood habitats showed that flooding enhanced anaerobiosis and salinity and altered the carbon and nitrogen plant–soil cycles. Higher flooding favored the invasive species more than the two native species. The invasive P. australis accumulated more carbon (65% increase in aboveground biomass), and took up more nitrogen under high flooding than did C. malaccensis and S. triqueter. The more conservative use of soil resources, particularly the limiting nutrient N, appeared to underlie the higher capacity of the invasive species to tolerate higher flooding intensity. Increases in flooding may thus enhance the success and expansion of the invasive P. australis to the detriment of the native plant species in these Chinese wetlands.",

The M haplotype retained 50% of its growth potential up to 0.4 M NaCl, whereas the F and AC haplotypes did not grow above 0.1 M NaCl. The M haplotype produced more shoots per gram of rhizome tissue and had higher relative growth rates than the native haplotypes on both freshwater and saline water treatments. The M haplotype also differed from the native haplotypes in shoot water content and the biometrics of shoots and rhizomes. The results offer an explanation for how the M haplotype is able to spread in coastal salt marshes and support the conclusion of DNA analyses that the M haplotype is a distinct ecotype of P. australis.",

This study examines the morphology of incipient foredunes and established foredunes associated with these species at two sites, Mason Bay in southern New Zealand, and the Younghusband Peninsula in South Australia. Both species invaded the existing foredunes very rapidly. In both cases the antecedent topography comprised relatively sparsely vegetated, irregular foredunes. Invasion resulted in continuous, regular, evenly vegetated foredunes. At Mason Bay a massive foredune has formed since 1958, in conjunction with Ammophila. Thinopyrum has formed an incipient foredune, with a ramp or terrace morphology, along the Younghusband Peninsula, South Australia. In both cases gaps in the former foredune have been closed and the indigenous foredune vegetation has been displaced. Both species may decrease the frequency and severity of blowout development. They are likely to be resilient to aeolian processes of sedimentation compared with dunes formed by indigenous species. Ammophila survives burial, is tolerant of drought and is resistant to erosion associated with storm surge and high waves. Thinopyrum is very tolerant of salinity. These species may adversely affect the long-term development of coastal barriers by inhibiting transgressive dune development.",

            "abstractNote": "Ice sheet mass balance estimates have improved substantially in recent years using a variety of techniques, over different time periods, and at various levels of spatial detail. Considerable disparity remains between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates, and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century.",

These impacts can be particularly visible in areas of national cultural and heritage significance, raising public awareness of a growing global trend and often requiring urgent changes to management practices. New Zealand has a relatively long history of invasive alien species with the introduction of non-native marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) for sand stabilisation and erosion control since the mid-nineteenth century. Of national importance, the sand dunes of the Hokianga Harbour are considered to be the spiritual birthplace of Māori culture in New Zealand and have experienced substantial vegetation change over the last century. Here we report a multi-disciplinary study combining palaeoecology with historic and contemporary observations to better characterise the changing distribution and mechanisms of spread of invasive alien species on the Hokianga headland. Our analysis indicates the vegetation established on the headland is primarily linked to late Pleistocene water-retaining, lignite deposits. We find, however, an abrupt increase in the area colonised by invasive alien species during the late twentieth century, most probably linked to reduced sediment supply in the Hokianga Harbour. Urgent management strategies may be required if the present dune headland is to be conserved, particularly against a backdrop of rising sea level which will most probably limit sediment resupply.",

            "abstractNote": "Dispersal of intertidal mussel propagules was examined by sampling larvae (0.2 to 0.8 mm) of Perna perna in shallow (10 to 20 m) inshore waters on the south coast of South Africa. Mussels were randomly distributed through the water column\nwith no signs of diel vertical migration. Horizontal distribution was sampled on fine scale grids of plankton stations on 5 occasions. Lines of stations ran offshore and were 300 m apart. Within each line, stations were 10 m apart. On each occasion grids\nwere sampled 3 to 4 times in rapid succession so that each station was sampled at intervals of about 1 h. Distribution was patchy and denser clouds of larvae moved in the same direction and at the same speeds as surface currents. Displacement of passive\nparticles moving with wind-driven currents was estimated from wind data. Over periods of 1 mo estimated total displacement was 118 to 220 km depending on month and year. However, because of frequent changes in wind direction, net displacement for any\nmonth was 54 to 164 km to the northeast. These estimates were compared with the rate of spread over 4 yr of an invasive intertidal mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) dispersing initially from a single-point source. Spread was estimated as the\nfurthest occurrence of M. galloprovincialis from the parent population. After 4 yr, 90% of individuals sampled were <5 km from the original population. Yearly increase in range between 1988 (introduction to the area) and 1992 was strongly\ndirectional: 55 to 97 km to the northeast and 12 to 29 km to the southwest. The good match with estimates from wind data implies that mussel larvae in this region are dispersed like passive particles and that dispersal direction and ranges can be\npredicted from hydrographic data. The results strongly suggest that maximum effective dispersal of mussel larvae in this area is relatively limited (<100 km), with the great majority of successful recruits appearing within <5 km of the parent\npopulation.",

Spartina anglica and S. alterniflora were introduced to China from England in 1963 and from the United States in 1979, respectively. Today, S. alterniflora has expanded its coverage to more than 112 000 ha and S. anglica has declined to <50 ha. This is compared with only 260 ha of S. alterniflora and over 36 000 ha of S. anglica in 1985. The fates of Chinese Spartina, with dramatic expansion of S. alterniflora and significant decline of S. anglica, were different from those in other locations throughout the world. Factors affecting the growth of the two naturalized Spartina species in China include differences in artificial plantation strategy, impacts of tideland reclamation, species competition ability and genetic diversity. Several methods for Spartina control in China, such as harvesting, herbicide application and freshwater irrigation, have been developed, but more research is needed to verify their effectiveness.",

Here we show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem(4), that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year. However, elevated CO2 does not enhance production in a drought year. We also found that aboveground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increases more at elevated CO2 than in several species of native annuals. Consequently, elevated CO2 might enhance the longterm success and dominance of exotic annual grasses in the region. This shift in species composition in favour of exotic annual grasses, driven by global change, has the potential to accelerate the fire cycle, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the deserts of western North America.",

However, the mechanisms underlying such shifts in interaction strength are poorly understood. Here, we test whether ocean acidification, driven by elevated seawater pCO(2), increases the susceptibility of native Olympia oysters to predation by invasive snails. Oysters raised under elevated pCO2 experienced a 20% increase in drilling predation. When presented alongside control oysters in a choice experiment, 48% more high-CO2 oysters were consumed. The invasive snails were tolerant of elevated CO2 with no change in feeding behaviour. Oysters raised under acidified conditions did not have thinner shells, but were 29-40% smaller than control oysters, and these smaller individuals were consumed at disproportionately greater rates. Reduction in prey size is a common response to environmental stress that may drive increasing per capita effects of stress-tolerant invasive predators.",

However, species responses to climate change are predicted to be more strongly affected by extreme events than by changes in mean values. As a result, measuring species' responses to extreme events in addition to the mean changes in climate are necessary to predict species range limits under future conditions. This study examines the impacts of a cold spell in southern Florida on native and an introduced oil-collecting bees by examining the bees' interactions with two native plants species. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts from an extreme cold event on a native, subtropical bee vs. an introduced, tropical bee. Specifically, the cold spell had little impact on the abundance of the native bee, while the abundance of the introduced, tropical bee was negatively impacted. Our findings demonstrate that extreme cold spells are important climate change-related phenomena that can have strong impacts on tropical species distributions and abundances, especially at the threshold of their thermal tolerances. Our approach also provided a rare opportunity to examine these impacts on multiple interacting species, which provides a more realistic assessment of the potential impacts of climate change.",

Undesirable species are strongly associated with fragmented landscapes, especially those with linearly arranged elements to facilitate dispersal, and with land uses that serve as population sources. In some cases, structural legacies, such as land use histories, were as important as current landscape patterns. Many undesirable species also influenced landscape structure by altering disturbance regimes via a wide range of abiotic and biotic mechanisms, including by affecting abundance of keystone, foundation or engineering species at landscape scales, and by changing species interactions in ways that prompted community-level changes. In some instances, the effects of species on landscapes facilitated invasion and/or population growth to establish positive feedback cycles. Understanding the reciprocal effects of landscape pattern on invasive and overabundant species can help guide effective management strategies by increasing the cost-efficiency of conservation investments and prioritizing conservation actions.",

To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied at an operational scale in natural marine habitats, in part because of the perceived risk of adverse non-target effects on native ecosystems. In this paper, we focus on the persistence, spread and non-target effects of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus when used as biocontrol agent to eradicate an invasive kelp from Fiordland, New Zealand. Rocky reef macrobenthic assemblages were monitored over 17 months in areas where the indigenous algal canopy was either removed or left intact prior to the translocation of a large number of urchins (>50 ind.·m−2). Urchin densities in treated areas significantly declined ∼9 months after transplant, and began spreading to adjacent sites. At the end of the 17-month study, densities had declined to ∼5 ind.·m−2. Compared to controls, treatment sites showed persistent shifts from kelp forest to urchin barrens, which were accompanied by significant reductions in taxa richness. Although these non-target effects were pronounced, they were considered to be localised and reversible, and arguably outweigh the irreversible and more profound ecological impacts associated with the establishment of an invasive species in a region of high conservation value. Augmentative biocontrol, used in conjunction with traditional control methods, represents a promising tool for the integrated management of marine pests.",

These gatherings have had no societal organization, thus the published proceedings are the main source of information on the recent history of this sub-discipline. Only 1144 individuals (mostly entomologists and plant pathologists) have ever attended an ISBCW: 338 (29.6%) have been at more than one symposium, bringing the total number of attendees to 1972. About 75% of these have come from the main WBC implementing nations, the USA, Australia, South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand. The present analysis of ISBCW attendees has led to estimates that the global WBC research and development effort over the last 50years has been the domain of about 450–550 WBC practitioners. WBC is presently beleaguered in the USA, Canada and Australia and attendance figures at recent ISBCWs are in decline. A case is made that these trends are largely due to the negative perceptions and damaging consequences of two decades of debates that have exaggerated the risks of non-target impacts and impeded progress in WBC. Further procrastination seems inevitable but in the interests of agriculture and conservation, WBC will need to be deployed more extensively if invasive alien (i.e., introduced, non-indigenous) plants are to be suppressed. In this context, the recent releases of WBC agents in Europe are signal events. It is mooted that a more formal and structured organization for the ISBCW meetings and perhaps a ‘rebranding’ of the sub-discipline is needed to champion and rekindle the practice of WBC.",

            "abstractNote": "Mutualisms structure ecosystems and mediate their functioning. They also enhance invasions of many alien species. Invasions disrupt native mutualisms, often leading to population declines, reduced biodiversity, and altered ecosystem functioning. Focusing on three main types of mutualisms (pollination, seed dispersal, and plant-microbial symbioses) and drawing on examples from different ecosystems and from species- and community-level studies, we review the key mechanisms whereby such positive interactions mediate invasions and are in turn inﬂuenced by invasions. High interaction generalization is “the norm” in most systems, allowing alien species to inﬁltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that inﬂuence invasiveness (e.g., selﬁng capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions. Mutualistic disruptions due to invasions are pervasive, and subsequent cascading effects are also widespread. Ecological networks provide a useful framework for predicting tipping points for community collapse in response to invasions and other synergistic drivers of global change.",

            "abstractNote": "A systematic review focused by plant on non-target impacts from agents deliberately introduced for the biological control of weeds found significant non-target impacts to be rare. The magnitude of direct impact of 43 biocontrol agents on 140 non-target plants was retrospectively categorized using a risk management framework for ecological impacts of invasive species (minimal, minor, moderate, major, massive). The vast majority of agents introduced for classical biological control of weeds (>99% of 512 agents released) have had no known significant adverse effects on non-target plants thus far; major effects suppressing non-target plant populations could be expected to be detectable. Most direct non-target impacts on plants (91.6%) were categorized as minimal or minor in magnitude with no known adverse long-term impact on non-target plant populations, but a few cacti and thistles are affected at moderate (n = 3), major (n = 7) to massive (n = 1) scale. The largest direct impacts are from two agents (Cactoblastis cactorum on native cacti and Rhinocyllus conicus on native thistles), but these introductions would not be permitted today as more balanced attitudes exist to plant biodiversity, driven by both society and the scientific community. Our analysis shows (as far as is known), weed biological control agents have a biosafety track record of >99% of cases avoiding significant non-target impacts on plant populations. Some impacts could have been overlooked, but this seems unlikely to change the basic distribution of very limited adverse effects. Fewer non-target impacts can be expected in future because of improved science and incorporation of wider values. Failure to use biological control represents a significant opportunity cost from the certainty of ongoing adverse impacts from invasive weeds. It is recommended that a simple five-step scale be used to better communicate the risk of consequences from both action (classical biological control) and no action (ongoing impacts from invasive weeds).",

            "abstractNote": "Belowground biota can deeply influence plant invasion. The presence of appropriate soil mutualists can act as a driver to enable plants to colonize new ranges. We reviewed the species of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) that facilitate pine establishment in both native and non-native ranges, and that are associated with their invasion into nonforest settings. We found that one particular group of EMF, suilloid fungi, uniquely drive pine invasion in the absence of other EMF. Although the association with other EMF is variable, suilloid EMF are always associated with invasive pines, particularly at early invasion, when invasive trees are most vulnerable. We identified five main ecological traits of suilloid fungi that may explain their key role at pine invasions: their long-distance dispersal capacity, the establishment of positive biotic interactions with mammals, their capacity to generate a resistant spore bank, their rapid colonization of roots and their long-distance exploration type. These results suggest that the identity of mycorrhizal fungi and their ecological interactions, rather than simply the presence of compatible fungi, are key to the understanding of plant invasion processes and their success or failure. Particularly for pines, their specific association with suilloid fungi determines their invasion success in previously uninvaded ecosystems.",

Streams of the American Southwest support a highly endemic, highly endangered native fish fauna and abundant non-native fishes, and here we investigated the hypothesis that beaver ponds in this region may lead to fish assemblages dominated by non-native species that favour slower-water habitat. We sampled fish assemblages within beaver ponds and within unimpounded lotic stream reaches in the mainstem and in tributaries of the free-flowing upper Verde River, Arizona, USA. Non-native fishes consistently outnumbered native species, and this dominance was greater in pond than in lotic assemblages. Few native species were recorded within ponds. Multivariate analysis indicated that fish assemblages in beaver ponds were distinct from those in lotic reaches, in both mainstem and tributary locations. Individual species driving this distinction included abundant non-native green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) in pond sites, and native desert sucker (Catostomus clarkii) in lotic sites. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that, relative to unimpounded lotic habitat, beaver ponds in arid and semi-arid rivers support abundant non-native fishes; these ponds could thus serve as important non-native source areas and negatively impact co-occurring native fish populations.",

Horses have been suggested to be an important source for the introduction of non-native plant species along trails, but the conclusions were based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, horse hay, manure, and hoof debris samples were collected from 12 to 24 horses at five endurance ride events in North Carolina, Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. One sub-sample of each material from each horse was sown in pots and grown under ideal conditions to determine if horse hay, manure, and hoof debris samples contained seeds from non-native species. A second sub-sample of each material from each horse was placed back on their respective trail to determine what plants would germinate and establish on the trail. Vegetation surveys were also conducted along 50m transects perpendicular to horse and hiking (horses not permitted) trails at three of the five sites to compare species composition of native and non-native plant species. On average, non-native plant species germinated in 5.2% of the hay samples in the pots, but non-native species did not germinate from the manure or hoof debris samples. Only 3 of the 288 (≈1% of total samples) hay, manure, and hoof debris plots established on horse trails at the five sites contained plants, all of which were native plants, at the end of the first growing season and no plants were observed at the end of the second growing season. Non-native species composition and percent of total plants species did not differ significantly (p=0.56) between horse and non-horse trails, and non-native plant species were only found within 2m of the trail. The results of this and another study [Campbell, J.E., Gibson, D.J., 2001. The effect of seeds of exotic species transported vie horse dung on vegetation along trail corridors. Plant Ecology 157, 23–35] demonstrate that horse hay and manure does contain seeds of non-native plant species, but native and non-native plant species rarely become established on horse trails because of the harsh environmental conditions. Management and policy implication of this study are discussed.",

Ecological studies recognize the importance of these extremes as drivers of plant growth and mortality, as well as drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we review observational and experimental studies on ECEs on herbaceous plants and shrubs. Extreme events considered were heat waves, drought, advanced or delayed snowmelt, heavy rainfalls, frosts, pulsed watering and flooding. We analysed 39 studies dealing with direct response of plant to ECEs in different ecosystems, with a particular focus on cold ecosystems (alpine and arctic). Although the number of studies increases every year, the understanding of ecological consequences of ECEs is fragmentary. In general, ECEs affected negatively on physiological processes (efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential), productivity and reproduction, and had consequences on population demography and recruitment several years after ECE. Indeed, the plant responses to ECEs were species specific and depended on the plant life stage and the timing of ECE. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of ECEs decreased over the growing season. Drought had the most severe effect on plants, while heat waves had minor effect if water was available. The overlap of different ECEs had an additive effect (e.g. drought associated to heat-waves). In general, both neutral or positive plant responses were found and acclimation is possible. In some cases, ECEs exert a strong selective pressure on plant species.",

            "abstractNote": "Vegetation and biogeomorphology are highly coupled in beach dune systems, but plant species effects on abating storm erosion are largely unexplored. We quantified coastal dune erosion from Hurricane Sandy (October 2012) as a function of pre-storm system characteristics – dune height, beach width and dominant vegetation stabilizing dunes (native Ammophila breviligulata or invasive Carex kobomugi) at Island Beach State Park, New Jersey, USA. We assessed dune erosion using a combination of pre- and post-Sandy aerial image spatial analyses in ArcGIS and GPS field mapping. Our two erosion metrics are novel, macroscale 2D surface area changes and Dune Crest Transgression, the later of which is measured at the microscale (1 m−1) and analysed using a mixed model incorporating spatial autocorrelation. We document a species-specific effect on collision erosion. Although C. kobomugi reduces native diversity and abundance, it may be beneficial for coastal protection, as dunes fronted and stabilized by C. kobomugi suffered less erosion than those dominated by A. breviligulata under the same abiotic conditions. Dune height and beach width were equal for species prior to the storm and therefore do not account for or confound differences in erosion. Similarly, traditional calculations of erosion with volumetric loss confer these results. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show a species effect on coastal dune erosion. Native Ammophila breviligulata stabilized dune stretches suffered more erosion from Hurricane Sandy than complimentary invasive Carex kobomugi stretches, contradicting anecdotal reports that foredunes stabilized by a shorter statured species are more prone to erosion. This study highlights the importance of vegetation for dune stability and management using two novel metrics for erosion. Our erosion metrics are related to volumetric loss, can be monitored and calculated by managers with or without remote sensing, and can be applied to other systems. Discussions on coastal management of dunes as habitats and protective buffers must include vegetation and the results of this study suggest that not all species are equal with regard to their ability to combat storm erosion. Multidisciplinary studies with applied implications will grow increasingly important as storms continue to grow more frequent, severe and unpredictable with climate change.",

ECEs and the invasion of alien species are among the main reasons for catastrophic transformations of aquatic ecosystems, watersheds, and human activities worldwide. Along with other negative results ECE may facilitate biological invasions. The objective of this review paper is to summarize how extreme climatic events may improve the likelihood of successful invasions in aquatic ecosystems and analyze some of the mechanisms. The morphometric characteristics of water bodies and their positions in the landscape connectivity may influence lake processes. ECE may result in an extreme ecological response – destabilization of an ecosystem and abrupt shift towards an alternative new state. Lakes' peculiarities mediate the effect of ECE influences on a lake ecosystem and determine whether the ecosystem response will be catastrophic or not. Different ecosystem alternative stable states have different levels of ecosystem immunity to invasions. ECEs can destabilize ecosystems and push them towards a tipping point where an ecosystem is most vulnerable. In a destabilized ecosystem near tipping point, ecosystem immunity is sharply decreased and the ‘door’ for alien species opens. The invasion process has several steps, and ECEs influence all of them. We are beginning to understand the association of ECE with invasions; to gain a deeper understanding of this we should integrate and coordinate the joint efforts of climatologists, hydrologists, limnologists, ecologists and biologists in this direction.",

            "abstractNote": "Animal dispersers in new areas are essential for many alien plants since they allow seeds movement and might promote seed germination and seedling establishment, increasing their chances of invasion. Here we review the published literature on seed dispersal of alien plant species by native and/or alien animals. We aim to answer the following questions: (i) Are interactions between alien plants and their animal dispersers evenly studied worldwide? (ii) Which are the distinctive traits (i.e. geographical origin, life form, dispersal strategy and propagule traits) of alien plants dispersed by animals? (iii) Which are the most studied groups of dispersers of alien plants around the world? (iv) Does literature provide evidence for the invasional meltdown hypothesis (alien plant-alien disperser facilitation)? (v) Which is the role of animal dispersers in the different stages of the alien plant regeneration process? Our dataset consisting of 204 articles indicates that geographical distribution of the studies was highly heterogeneous among continents, with the highest number coming from North America and the lowest from Asia and Central America. Most of the alien plants involved in dispersal studies were woody species from Asia with fleshy fruits dispersed by endozoochory. More than the half of the animal dispersers was birds, followed by mammals, ants and reptiles. The dominance of bird-dispersal interactions over other animal groups remained consistent across geographical regions. Although most of the studies involved only native dispersers, alien-alien interactions were detected, suggesting the occurrence of invasional meltdown mechanisms. Of the total reviewed articles reporting seed removal, 74% evaluated seed dispersal, but only few studies include seed germination (35.3%), seedling establishment (5.4 %) or seed predation (23.5 %). Finally, this chapter provides some research biases and directions for future studies in the area.",

On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the endemic red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) and the introduced giant African snail (Achatina fulica) showed inverse patterns of abundance along gradients from disturbed habitat to intact rain forest: empty, but intact snail shells were abundant in disturbed habitat and rare in adjacent rain forest, while red crabs were abundant in rain forest and uncommon in disturbed habitat. The proportion of total snail shells that had been damaged by red crabs was much greater in rain forest. When snails were transplanted and tethered in both habitats, 97% were killed by red crabs in rain forest after 48 h, while in disturbed habitat only 22% of snails were killed by red crabs and the introduced fire ant (Solenopsis geminata). These results suggest that an endemic omnivore may restrict the distribution of an invader and that biotic resistance to invasion in undisturbed habitats can be strong on some islands.",

            "abstractNote": "The extent by which human activities create an inroad for the invasion of exotic plant species and the mechanisms that drive a disturbed ecosystem’s resistance to exotic invasion is largely unknown. We investigated the mechanisms by which salt marsh resists cordgrass (Spartina alterniﬂora) invasion by two key factors: anthropogenic disturbance by ditching and herbivory by the native crab Helice tientsinensis. In northern China, although abiotic resistance (i.e., hyper-stresses) inhibited the landward invasion of cordgrass to high marshes, our transplant experiments showed that anthropogenic ditching created windows of opportunity for cordgrass invasion to high marshes by enhancing propagule pressure and providing favorable (i.e., low-salinity and high-inundation) microhabitats for colonization. Furthermore, a native herbivore exclusion experiment showed that crab grazing strongly suppressed seedling establishment and growth of cordgrass in ditched high marshes, which gradually created native biotic resistance to cordgrass invasion. We conclude that grazing by native herbivores can enhance the resistance of high marshes to cordgrass invasion triggered by anthropogenic ditching disturbance in northern China. These ﬁndings highlight that it is critical to investigate ecosystem resistance associated with anthropogenic disturbance to better understand the multiple mechanisms of exotic plant invasion, and we call for integration of these ﬁndings into invasion control strategies.",

While studies have examined how species loss at the local level can inﬂuence invasion resistance, interactions between species loss and other components of environmental change remain poorly studied. In particular, the manner in which native diversity interacts with resource availability to inﬂuence invasion resistance is not well understood. We created experimental plant assemblages that varied in native species (1–16 species) and/or functional richness (deﬁned by rooting morphology and phenology; one to ﬁve functional groups). We crossed these diversity treatments with resource (water) addition to determine their interactive effects on invasion resistance to spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), a potent exotic invader in the intermountain West of the United States. We also determined how native diversity and resource addition inﬂuenced plant-available soil nitrogen, soil moisture, and light. Assemblages with lower species and functional diversity were more heavily invaded than assemblages with greater species and functional diversity. In uninvaded assemblages, experimental addition of water increased soil moisture and plant-available nitrogen and decreased light availability. The availability of these resources generally declined with increasing native plant diversity. Although water addition increased susceptibility to invasion, it did not fundamentally change the negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Thus, native diversity provided strong invasion resistance even under high resource availability. These results suggest that the effects of local diversity can remain robust despite enhanced resource levels that are predicted under scenarios of global change.",

            "abstractNote": "Sea level rise is a fundamental driver of ecosystem change and has the potential to shift the spatial distributions of habitats more rapidly than species can adapt. Rapid sea level rise and associated saltwater intrusion have negative impacts on coastal environments, including loss of habitat for species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. In Florida’s largest wetland, the Everglades, the availability of small fishes that are prey for wading birds serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. In the southwestern part of the ecosystem, sea level rise and a reduction in freshwater flow have converted formerly freshwater marsh into an estuarine mangrove-dominated landscape. In this study, we sampled fish communities in this southwest portion of the Everglades exposed to a range of saline conditions. Biomass of native fishes was highest at a salinity value of approximately 25 parts per thousand, while non-native biomass decreased with increasing salinity. Applying salinity change scenarios, we determined that a 10% reduction from the salinity levels recorded in this study would be optimal for biomass of native fishes. The baseline data we collected on non-native fishes at the site will be useful for monitoring as restoration progresses and for managers working on invasive species control. This region has been actively undergoing ecosystem restoration for the last decade, but restored freshwater flow closer to historical conditions is still years away. Without increased freshwater inflow from hydrologic restoration, rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion may provide conservation challenges for wading birds and their prey-base fishes.",

Meta-analyses of terrestrial\nexperiments demonstrate that native primary producers and herbivores generally resist invasions of primary\nproducers, and that resistance through competition strengthens with native producer diversity. To test the\ngenerality of these findings, we conducted a meta-analysis of marine experiments. We found that native\nmarine producers generally failed to resist producer invasions through competition unless the native community\nwas diverse, and this diversity effect was weaker in marine than in terrestrial systems. In contrast,\nnative consumers equally resisted invasive producers in both ecosystems. Most marine experiments,\nhowever, tested invasive consumers and these invasions were resisted more strongly than were producer\ninvasions. Given these differences between ecosystems and between marine trophic levels, we used a\nmodel-selection approach to assess if factors other than the resistance mechanism (i.e. competition vs. consumption)\nare more important for predicting marine biotic resistance. These results suggest that understanding\nmarine biotic resistance depends on latitude, habitat and invader taxon, in addition to\ndistinguishing between competition with and consumption by native species. By examining biotic resistance\nwithin and across ecosystems, our work provides a more complete understanding of the factors that underlie\nbiological invasions.",

We offer such an evaluation for six selected leading hypotheses. Our global literature review reveals that those hypotheses that consider interactions of exotic invaders with their new environment (invasional meltdown, novel weapons, enemy release) are better supported by empirical evidence than other hypotheses (biotic resistance, island susceptibility, tens rule). We also show that empirical support for the six hypotheses has declined over time, and that support differs among taxonomic groups and habitats. Our results have implications for basic and applied research, policy making, and invasive species management, as their effectiveness depends on sound hypotheses.",

We investigated the generality of this concept across ecosystems. Despite the\nconspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic resistance have focused mostly\non terrestrial and, more recently, marine coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies which\ntested the impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers and\nconsumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive biotic resistance in\nfreshwater habitats was not as strong as that in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater\necosystems consumptive resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and\n consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in marine and terrestrial\nsystems. The limited number of studies considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our\nability to understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied among freshwater habitats;\nspecifically, biotic resistance was strongest in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies\nmechanisms underlying biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems which warrant further\n investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive species in these systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Lake Kutubu is a tropical freshwater lake that is internationally renowned for its biodiversity, 12 endemic species of fish, wetlands, and swamp forests. This study reports on a fish kill and the introduction of exotic species, and it assesses impacts on fish stocks and the artisanal fishery. The fish kill, which began in January 2013 and lasted for 6 months, was characterized by fish pathologies consistent with epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Sleeper gobies and gudgeons (i.e., Mogurnda variegata Nichols, Mogurnda furva Allen & Hoese, Mogurnda kutubuensis Allen & Hoese, and Oxyeleotris fimbriata [Weber]) had more obvious signs of disease than did Hephaestus adamsoni (Trewavas), Melanotaenia lacustris Munro, and Craterocephalus lacustris Trewavas. The event coincided with an inflow of a plume of white particulates from the northeast, where hydrocarbon companies carried out extensive horizontal drilling in 2012–2013. Six months after the event, the main species caught by fishers were Cherax papuanus Holthuis (16%), H. adamsoni (55%) and M. lacustris (28%), which is different from the mix of species found in previous surveys of 1995 and 1997. The recent fish kill, as well as socioeconomic changes, substantially reduced the fish catch and fishing effort. Small-scale fish farmers began raising the genetically improved farmed tilapia strain of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus) in earthen ponds in 2009 and introduced water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes [Mart.] Solms) as a food for these fish. Heavy rains in 2010–2012 released farmed fish into the lake, and in May 2015, fishers report that the fish catch is dominated by tilapia. Improved strategies are required to educate stakeholders, assess fish stocks, and protect biodiversity by reducing anthropogenic impacts.",

            "abstractNote": "Along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia sea urchin disease outbreaks are statistically linked to North Atlantic hurricanes and warm sea temperatures. The amoebic pathogen Paramoeba invadens, which causes these disease outbreaks, is unable to withstand typical minimum sea temperatures along this coast, suggesting that it is reintroduced during periods of peak temperatures. Here, we examine hypotheses for mechanisms of introduction or persistence of P. invadens using data on sea urchin disease outbreaks from a 5‐yr field experiment (2010–2014), in combination with high‐temporal‐resolution oceanographic and meteorologic data. Disease outbreaks were observed in 4 yr, with the onset of mass mortality (≥50% morbidity or mortality) ranging from mid August to mid October. Physical data suggest that P. invadens originates in warm offshore surface waters that are transported to the coast during strong storms. Disease outbreaks were associated with passing hurricanes in 2 yr (2010 and 2011). In 2012, a disease outbreak occurred in the absence of a storm and following a strong positive anomaly in winter sea temperature, suggesting survival of the pathogen from 2011. In 2014, a disease outbreak occurred in association with a strong storm (nor'easter) that was not a hurricane. Our findings indicate that changing environmental conditions of increasing minimum sea temperatures and increasing intensity of storms may be altering the dynamics of this disease. These inferences remain equivocal, however, indicating the need for high‐resolution dynamical modeling of the physical environment and rapid identification of P. invadens in the environment using genetic tools.",

            "abstractNote": "High-resolution projections of climate change impacts on fire weather conditions in southeast Australia out to 2080 are presented. Fire weather is represented by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), calculated from an objectively designed regional climate model ensemble. Changes in annual cumulative FFDI vary widely, from − 337 (− 21%) to + 657 (+ 24%) in coastal areas and − 237 (− 12%) to + 1143 (+ 26%) in inland areas. A similar spread is projected in extreme FFDI values. In coastal regions, the number of prescribed burning days is projected to change from − 11 to + 10 in autumn and − 10 to + 3 in spring. Across the ensemble, the most significant increases in fire weather and decreases in prescribed burn windows are projected to take place in spring. Partial bias correction of FFDI leads to similar projections but with a greater spread, particularly in extreme values. The partially bias-corrected FFDI performs similarly to uncorrected FFDI compared to the observed annual cumulative FFDI (ensemble root mean square error spans 540 to 1583 for uncorrected output and 695 to 1398 for corrected) but is generally worse for FFDI values above 50. This emphasizes the need to consider inter-variable relationships when bias-correcting for complex phenomena such as fire weather. There is considerable uncertainty in the future trajectory of fire weather in southeast Australia, including the potential for less prescribed burning days and substantially greater fire danger in spring. Selecting climate models on the basis of multiple criteria can lead to more informative projections and allow an explicit exploration of uncertainty.",

            "abstractNote": "Global-mean sea-level rise will drive impacts and adaptation needs around the world's coasts over the 21st century and beyond. A key element in assessing these issues is the development of scenarios (or plausible futures) of local relative sea-level rise to support impact assessment and adaptation planning. This requires combining a number of different but uncertain components of sea level which can be linked to climatic and non-climatic (i.e., uplift/subsidence of coastal land) factors. A major concern remains about the possibility of significant contributions from the major Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and this must be factored into the assessments, despite the uncertainty. This paper reviews the different mechanisms which contribute to sea-level change and considers a methodology for combining the available data to create relative (or local) sea-level rise scenarios suitable for impact and adaptation assessments across a range of sophistication of analysis. The methods that are developed are pragmatic and consider the different needs of impact assessment, adaptation planning, and long-term decision making. This includes the requirements of strategic decision makers who rightly focus on low probability but high consequence changes and their consequences. Hence plausible high end sea-level rise scenarios beyond the conventional Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) range and which take into account evidence beyond that from the current generation of climate models are developed and their application discussed. Continued review and development of sea-level scenarios is recommended, starting with assimilating the insights of the forthcoming IPCC AR5 assessment.

Installation of shoreline protection structures is increasing in response to rising sea levels and increasing frequency of intense storms. Shoreline hardening structures can facilitate establishment of non-native species with multiple potential consequences. We measured abundances of both native and non-native Codium, a green macroalga, on natural hard substrates (oyster reefs) and artificial substrates (bulkheads and revetments) in two estuaries and assessed the effects of each Codium species on nitrogen fixation and net N2 fluxes. Native C. decorticatum was the most abundant (86 %) Codium on oyster reefs, while exotic C. fragile dominated (99 %) artificial substrates. N2 production via denitrification was greater than nitrogen fixation for both species and the net N2 production associated with non-native C. fragile was greater than with native C. decorticatum. Comparing our results with surveys conducted in the 1940s before C. fragile had invaded, indicates that non-native Codium has outcompeted native Codium on artificial substrates, but that natural substrate provided by oyster reefs remains a refuge for native Codium. Although shoreline hardening with artificial structures can reduce ecosystem services provided by coastal marsh and other habitats, an unexpected beneficial consequence was the N2 production associated with the non-native Codium, which has the potential to mitigate anthropogenic nutrient loading. Our results illustrate that the interaction between multiple anthropogenic impacts can be positive, and indicate that non-ephemeral macroalgae could be an overlooked component in nitrogen removal from marine ecosystems by enhancing denitrification.",

We analysed the effects of changes in water temperature and salinity on the species pool of freshwater molluscs in the river Rhine. Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for maximum temperature and salinity tolerance were constructed for native and non-native species that are currently present in the river Rhine. The maximum temperature tolerance was significantly higher for non-native mollusc species than native ones. For salinity tolerance, no significant difference was found between the two groups. The SSDs were used to determine the potentially not occurring fractions (PNOFs) of each species group corresponding with the yearly maximum water temperature and salinity levels recorded in (1) different river sections for the extreme warm and dry year 2003, and (2) the river Rhine at Lobith (The Netherlands) over the period 1960–2009. Changing temperature and salinity conditions in the river Rhine over the past 50 years corresponded with a net increase in PNOF for native species. This was mainly due to rising river water temperatures, which had a larger influence than decreasing salinity levels. For non-native species no change in PNOF was found, indicating that future temperature rise will disproportionally affect native mollusc species. Validation of the PNOF estimated for Lobith with the not occurring fraction (NOF) of mollusc species derived from monitoring data revealed similar trends for native as well as non-native mollusc species richness. The increase in the PNOF accounted for 14% of the increase in the NOF. The construction and application of SSDs appeared a promising approach to address the separate and combined effects of changing abiotic conditions on native and non-native species pools.",

Regardless of this uncertainty, flooding by tropical cyclones will increase as a result of accelerated sea-level rise. Under similar rates of rapid sea-level rise during the early Holocene epoch most low-lying sedimentary coastlines were generally much less resilient to storm impacts. Society must learn to live with a rapidly evolving shoreline that is increasingly prone to flooding from tropical cyclones. These impacts can be mitigated partly with adaptive strategies, which include careful stewardship of sediments and reductions in human-induced land subsidence.",

            "abstractNote": "Human‐aided transport is responsible for many contemporary species introductions, yet the contribution of human‐aided transport to dispersal within non‐native regions is less clear. Understanding dispersal dynamics for invasive species can streamline mitigation efforts by targeting routes that contribute disproportionally to spread. Because of its limited natural dispersal ability, rapid spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) has been attributed to human‐aided transport, but until now, the relative roles of human‐aided and natural movement have not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we use landscape genetics and information‐theoretic model selection to evaluate 52 models representing 9240 pairwise dispersal paths among sites across the US range for Ae. albopictus and show that recent gene flow reflects a combination of natural and human‐aided dispersal. Highways and water availability facilitate dispersal at a broad spatial scale, but gene flow is hindered by forests at the current distributional limit (range edge) and by agriculture among sites within the mosquito's native climatic niche (range core). Our results show that highways are important to genetic structure between range‐edge and range‐core pairs, suggesting a role for human‐aided mosquito transport to the range edge. In contrast, natural dispersal is dominant at smaller spatial scales, reflecting a shifting dominance to natural movement two decades after introduction. These conclusions highlight the importance of (i) early intervention for species introductions, particularly those with readily dispersed dormant stages and short generation times, and (ii) strict monitoring of commercial shipments for transported immature stages of Ae. albopictus, particularly towards the northern edge of the US range.",

Its contribution has not yet been systematically tested because of the previous lack of global data on winds. We used global winds coverage from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration SeaWinds scatterometer to test whether floristic similarities of Southern Hemisphere moss, liverwort, lichen, and pteridophyte floras conform better with (i) the anisotropic LDD hypothesis, which predicts that connection by “wind highways” increases floristic similarities, or (ii) a direction-independent LDD hypothesis, which predicts that floristic similarities among sites increase with geographic proximity. We found a stronger correlation of floristic similarities with wind connectivity than with geographic proximities, which supports the idea that wind is a dispersal vehicle for many organisms in the Southern Hemisphere.",

Barbados, an outlying island in the Lesser Antilles, was formed approximately 700,000 YBP by tectonic uplift and was then colonized by birds via natural invasion from the much older volcanic islands in the main Lesser Antillean arc. We investigated the timing and sources of the avian invasion of Barbados by determining levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) divergence between populations of eight bird species from Barbados and those on the nearby putative source islands of St. Lucia and St. Vincent. Although all Barbados populations appeared to be young relative to the geological age of the island, we found differences among species in their inferred times of colonization and we identified at least two sources of immigrants to Barbados. In contrast to these historical differences across species and populations, our characterization of the mitochondrial genotypes of 231 individual birds suggests that each island population represents the descendants of a single founding maternal lineage. Considered in concert, the results of this molecular survey indicate that the Barbados bird community is composed of species with different invasion histories, which in turn suggests that the island's community composition has changed repeatedly over its 700,000 year history.",

Each theory that has been proposed — including land bridges and over-water dispersal — has involved over-water dispersal to some extent in the distribution of animals. Yet many people remain sceptical of over-water dispersal, believing that the use of rafts is improbable, unobservable and consequently untenable. Here we present evidence to support over-water dispersal as the mechanism by which green iguanas colonized Anguilla.",
