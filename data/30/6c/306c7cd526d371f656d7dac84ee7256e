            "abstractNote": "The legacy of deliberate and accidental introductions of invasive alien species to Australia has had a hefty economic toll, yet quantifying the magnitude of the costs associated with direct loss and damage, as well as for management interventions, remains elusive. This is because the reliability of cost estimates and under-sampling have not been determined. We provide the first detailed analysis of the reported costs associated with invasive species to the Australian economy since the 1960s, based on the recently published InvaCost database and supplementary information, for a total of 2078 unique cost entries. Since the 1960s, Australia has spent or incurred losses totalling at least US$298.58 billion (2017 value) or AU$389.59 billion (2017 average exchange rate) from invasive species. However, this is an underestimate given that costs rise as the number of estimates increases following a power law. There was an average 1.8–6.3-fold increase in the total costs per decade since the 1970s to the present, producing estimated costs of US$6.09–57.91 billion year\n              -1\n              (all costs combined) or US$225.31 million–6.84 billion year\n              -1\n              (observed, highly reliable costs only). Costs arising from plant species were the highest among kingdoms (US$151.68 billion), although most of the costs were not attributable to single species. Of the identified weedy species, the costliest were annual ryegrass (\n              Lolium rigidum\n              ), parthenium (\n              Parthenium hysterophorus\n              ) and ragwort (\n              Senecio jacobaea\n              ). The four costliest classes were mammals (US$48.63 billion), insects (US$11.95 billion), eudicots (US$4.10 billion) and monocots (US$1.92 billion). The three costliest species were all animals – cats (\n              Felis catus\n              ), rabbits (\n              Oryctolagus cuniculus\n              ) and red imported fire ants (\n              Solenopsis invicta\n              ). Each State/Territory had a different suite of major costs by species, but with most (3–62%) costs derived from one to three species per political unit. Most (61%) of the reported costs applied to multiple environments and 73% of the total pertained to direct damage or loss compared to management costs only, with both of these findings reflecting the availability of data. Rising incursions of invasive species will continue to have substantial costs for the Australian economy, but with better investment, standardised assessments and reporting and coordinated interventions (including eradications), some of these costs could be substantially reduced.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive alien species are responsible for a high economic impact on many sectors worldwide. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies assessing these impacts in Central and South America. Investigating costs of invasions is important to motivate and guide policy responses by increasing stakeholders’ awareness and identifying action priorities. Here, we used the InvaCost database to investigate (i) the geographical pattern of biological invasion costs across the region; (ii) the monetary expenditure across taxa and impacted sectors; and (iii) the taxa responsible for more than 50% of the costs (hyper-costly taxa) per impacted sector and type of costs. The total of reliable and observed costs reported for biological invasions in Central and South America was USD 102.5 billion between 1975 and 2020, but about 90% of the total costs were reported for only three countries (Brazil, Argentina and Colombia). Costs per species were associated with geographical regions (i.e., South America, Central America and Islands) and with the area of the countries in km\n              2\n              . Most of the expenses were associated with damage costs (97.8%), whereas multiple sectors (77.4%), agriculture (15%) and public and social welfare (4.2%) were the most impacted sectors.\n              Aedes\n              spp. was the hyper-costly taxon for the terrestrial environment (costs of USD 25 billion) and water hyacinth (\n              Eichhornia crassipes\n              ) was the hyper-costly taxon for the aquatic environment (USD 179.9 million). Six taxa were classified as hyper-costly for at least one impacted sector and two taxa for at least one type of cost. In conclusion, invasive alien species caused billions of dollars of economic burden in Central and South America, mainly in large countries of South America. Costs caused by invasive alien species were unevenly distributed across countries, impacted sectors, types of costs and taxa (hyper-costly taxa). These results suggest that impacted sectors should drive efforts to manage the species that are draining financial sources.",

Whilst the ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) have been widely reported in recent decades, there remains a paucity of information concerning their economic impacts. Europe has strong trade and transport links with the rest of the world, facilitating hundreds of IAS incursions, and largely centralised decision-making frameworks. The present study is the first comprehensive and detailed effort that quantifies the costs of IAS collectively across European countries and examines temporal trends in these data. In addition, the distributions of costs across countries, socioeconomic sectors and taxonomic groups are examined, as are socio-economic correlates of management and damage costs. Total costs of IAS in Europe summed to US$140.20 billion (or €116.61 billion) between 1960 and 2020, with the majority (60%) being damage-related and impacting multiple sectors. Costs were also geographically widespread but dominated by impacts in large western and central European countries, i.e. the UK, Spain, France, and Germany. Human population size, land area, GDP, and tourism were significant predictors of invasion costs, with management costs additionally predicted by numbers of introduced species, research effort and trade. Temporally, invasion costs have increased exponentially through time, with up to US$23.58 billion (€19.64 billion) in 2013, and US$139.56 billion (€116.24 billion) in impacts extrapolated in 2020. Importantly, although these costs are substantial, there remain knowledge gaps on several geographic and taxonomic scales, indicating that these costs are severely underestimated. We, thus, urge increased and improved cost reporting for economic impacts of IAS and coordinated international action to prevent further spread and mitigate impacts of IAS populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species have caused severe impacts on biodiversity and human society. Although the estimation of environmental impacts caused by invasive species has increased in recent years, economic losses associated with biological invasions are only sporadically estimated in space and time. In this study, we synthesized the losses incurred by invasions in Asia, based on the most comprehensive database of economic costs of invasive species worldwide, including 560 cost records for 88 invasive species in 22 countries. We also assessed the differences in economic costs across taxonomic groups, geographical regions and impacted sectors, and further identified the major gaps of current knowledge in Asia. Reported economic costs of biological invasions were estimated between 1965 and 2017, and reached a total of US$ 432.6 billion (2017 value), with dramatic increases in 2000–2002 and in 2004. The highest costs were recorded for terrestrial ectotherms, for species estimated in South Asia, and for species estimated at the country level, and were related to more than one impacted sector. Two taxonomic groups with the highest reported costs were insects and mammals, and two countries with the highest costs were India and China. Non-English data covered all of 12 taxonomic groups, whereas English data only covered six groups, highlighting the importance of considering data from non-English sources to have a more comprehensive estimation of economic costs associated with biological invasions. However, we found that the estimation of economic costs was lacking for most Asian countries and for more than 96% of introduced species in Asia. Further, the estimation is heavily biased towards insects and mammals and is very limited concerning expenditures on invasion management. To optimize the allocation of limited resources, there is an important need to better and more widely study the economic costs of invasive alien species. In this way, improved cost reporting and more collaborations between scientists and stakeholders are needed across Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species can have severe impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human health. Though the economic impacts of invasions provide important foundations for management and policy, up-to-date syntheses of these impacts are lacking. To produce the most comprehensive estimate of invasive species costs within North America (including the Greater Antilles) to date, we synthesized economic impact data from the recently published InvaCost database. Here, we report that invasions have cost the North American economy at least US$ 1.26 trillion between 1960 and 2017. Economic costs have climbed over recent decades, averaging US$ 2 billion per year in the early 1960s to over US$ 26 billion per year in the 2010s. Of the countries within North America, the United States (US) had the highest recorded costs, even after controlling for research effort within each country ($5.81 billion per cost source in the US). Of the taxa and habitats that could be classified in our database, invasive vertebrates were associated with the greatest costs, with terrestrial habitats incurring the highest monetary impacts. In particular, invasive species cumulatively (from 1960–2017) cost the agriculture and forestry sectors US$ 527.07 billion and US$ 34.93 billion, respectively. Reporting issues (e.g., data quality or taxonomic granularity) prevented us from synthesizing data from all available studies. Furthermore, very few of the known invasive species in North America had reported economic costs. Therefore, while the costs to the North American economy are massive, our US$ 1.26 trillion estimate is likely very conservative. Accordingly, expanded and more rigorous economic cost reports are necessary to provide more comprehensive invasion impact estimates, and then support data-based management decisions and actions towards species invasions.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions, as a result of human intervention through trade and mobility, are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss. The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs of IAS within its territory. Here, using \"InvaCost\", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated with IAS from English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (\n              Capra hircus\n              ; US$20 million), followed by\n              Aedes\n              mosquitoes (US$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus\n              Rubus\n              , a parasitic fly (\n              Philornis downsi\n              ), black rats (\n              Rattus rattus\n              ) and terrestrial gastropods (\n              Achatina fulica\n              ) represented less than US$2 million each. Costs of \"mixed-taxa\" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; US$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to\n              Aedes\n              mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of the IAS reported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country.",

            "abstractNote": "The ever-increasing number of introduced species profoundly threatens global biodiversity. While the ecological and evolutionary consequences of invasive alien species are receiving increasing attention, their economic impacts have largely remained understudied, especially in France. Here, we aimed at providing a general overview of the monetary losses (damages caused by) and expenditures (management of) associated with invasive alien species in France. This country has a long history of alien species presence, partly due to its long-standing global trade activities, highly developed tourism, and presence of overseas territories in different regions of the globe, resulting in a conservative minimum of 2,750 introduced and invasive alien species. By synthesizing for the first time the monetary losses and expenditures incurred by invasive alien species in Metropolitan France and French overseas territories, we obtained 1,583 cost records for 98 invasive alien species. We found that they caused a conservative total amount ranging between US$ 1,280 million and 11,535 million in costs over the period 1993–2018. We extrapolated costs for species invading France, for which costs were reported in other countries but not in France, which yielded an additional cost ranging from US$ 151 to 3,030 millions. Damage costs were nearly eight times higher than management expenditure. Insects, and in particular the Asian tiger mosquito\n              Aedes albopictus\n              and the yellow fever mosquito\n              Ae. aegypti\n              , totalled very high economic costs, followed by non-graminoid terrestrial flowering and aquatic plants (\n              Ambrosia artemisiifolia\n              ,\n              Ludwigia\n              sp. and\n              Lagarosiphon major\n              ). Over 90% of alien species currently recorded in France had no costs reported in the literature, resulting in high biases in taxonomic, regional and activity sector coverages. To conclude, we report alarming costs and even more alarming knowledge gaps. Our results should raise awareness of the importance of biosecurity and biosurveillance in France, and beyond, as well as the crucial need for better reporting and documentation of cost data.",

            "abstractNote": "Terrestrial ecosystems, owing to the presence of key socio-economic sectors such as agriculture and forestry, may be particularly economically affected by biological invasions. The present study uses a subset of the recently developed database of global economic costs of biological invasions (InvaCost) to quantify the monetary costs of biological invasions in Russia, the largest country in the world that spans two continents. From 2007 up to 2019, invasions costed the Russian economy at least US$ 51.52 billion (RUB 1.38 trillion, n = 94 cost entries), with the vast majority of these costs based on predictions or extrapolations (US$ 50.86 billion; n = 87) and, therefore, not empirically observed. Most cost entries exhibited low geographic resolution, being split between European and Asian parts of Russia (US$ 44.17 billion; n = 72). Just US$ 7.35 billion (n = 22) was attributed to the European part solely and none to the Asian part. Invasion costs were documented for 72 species and particularly insects (37 species). The empirically-observed costs, summing up to US$ 660 million (n = 7), were reported only for four species: two insects\n              Agrilus planipennis\n              Fairmaire and\n              Cydalima perspectalis\n              (Walker) and two plants\n              Ambrosia artemisiifolia\n              L. and\n              Heracleum sosnowskyi\n              Manden. The vast majority of economic costs were related to resource damages and economic losses, with very little reported expenditures on managing invasions in terrestrial ecosystems. In turn, agriculture (US$ 37.42 billion; n = 68) and forestry (US$ 14.0 billion; n = 20) were the most impacted sectors. Overall, we report burgeoning economic costs of invasions in Russia and identify major knowledge gaps, for example, concerning specific habitat types (i.e. aquatic) and management expenditures, as well as for numerous known invasive taxa with no reported economic costs (i.e. vertebrates). Given this massive, largely underestimated economic burden of invasions in Russia, our work is a call for improved reporting of costs nationally and internationally.",

            "abstractNote": "Economic assessments for invasive alien species (IAS) are an urgent requirement for informed decision-making, coordinating and motivating the allocation of economic and human resources for the management of IAS. We searched for economic costs of IAS occurring in Spain, by using the InvaCost database and requesting data to regional governments and national authorities, which resulted in over 3,000 cost entries. Considering only robust data (i.e. excluding extrapolated, potential (not-incurred or expected) and low reliability costs), economic costs in Spain were estimated at US$ 261 million (€ 232 million) from 1997 to 2022. There was an increase from US$ 4 million per year before 2000 to US$ 15 million per year in the last years (from € 4 to 13 million). Robust data showed that most reported costs of IAS in Spain (&gt; 90%) corresponded to management costs, while damage costs were only found for 2 out of the 174 species with reported costs. Economic costs relied mostly on regional and inter-regional administrations that spent 66% of costs in post-invasion management actions, contrary to all international guidelines, which recommend investing more in prevention. Regional administrations unequally reported costs. Moreover, 36% of the invasive species, reported to incur management costs, were not included in national or European regulations (i.e. Black Lists), suggesting the need to review these policies; besides, neighbouring regions seem to manage different groups of species. We suggest the need of a national lead agency to effectively coordinate actions, facilitate communication and collaboration amongst regional governments, national agencies and neighbouring countries. This will motivate the continuity of long-lasting management actions and the increase in efforts to report IAS costs by regional and inter-regional managers which will adequately provide information for future budgets gaining management effectiveness.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions are one of the leading causes of global environmental change and their impacts can affect biodiversity, ecosystem services, human health and the economy. Yet, the understanding on the impacts of invasive alien species is still limited and mostly related to alien species outbreaks and losses in agricultural yield, followed by the understanding of the ecological impacts on natural systems. Notably, the economic impacts of biological invasions have rarely been quantified. Brazil has at least 1214 known alien species from which 460 are recognized as invasive alien species. Still, there are no comprehensive estimates of the cost of their impact and management. Here, we aimed at filling this gap by providing a comprehensive estimate of the economic cost of biological invasions in Brazil. In order to quantify these costs for species, ecosystems and human well-being we used the InvaCost database which is the first global compilation of the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that Brazil reportedly spent a minimum of USD 105.53 billions over 35 years (1984–2019), with an average spent of USD 3.02 (± 9.8) billions per year. Furthermore, USD 104.33 billion were due to damages and losses caused by invaders, whereas only USD 1.19 billion were invested in their management (prevention, control or eradication). We also found that recorded costs were unevenly distributed across ecosystems, and socio-economic sectors, and were rarely evaluated and published. We found that the economic costs with losses and damages were substantially greater than those used for prevention, control or eradication of IAS. Since our data show costs reported in Brazil for only 16 invasive alien species, our estimates are likely a conservative minimum of the actual economic costs of biological invasions in Brazil. Taken together, they indicate that invasive alien species are an important cause of economic losses and that Brazil has mostly opted for paying for the damage incurred by biological invasions rather than investing in preventing them from happening.",

In most countries, available data on monetary costs of IAS are scarce, while being crucial for developing efficient management. In this study, we use available data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of IAS (InvaCost) to quantify and describe the economic cost of invasions in Mexico. This description was made across a range of taxonomic, sectoral and temporal variables, and allowed us to identify knowledge gaps within these areas. Overall, costs of invasions in Mexico were estimated at US$ 5.33 billion (i.e., 10\n              9\n              ) ($MXN 100.84 billion) during the period from 1992 to 2019. Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (US$ 1.16 billion; $MXN 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (US$ 1.17 billion; $MXN 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (US$ 2.99 billion; $MXN 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of IAS (US$ 4.29 billion vs. US$ 1.04 billion; $MXN 81.17 billion vs $MXN 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (US$ 1.01 billion; $MXN 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (US$ 517.24 million; $MXN 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to Mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. rodents, cats and goats), to a total of US$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to US$ 1.11 million in total.\n              Pterygoplichthys\n              sp. and\n              Eichhornia crassipes\n              caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in Mexico, and\n              Bemisia tabaci\n              to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in Mexico, management spending has been increasing. These estimates, albeit conservative, underline the monetary pressure that invasions put on the Mexican economy, calling for urgent actions alongside comprehensive cost reporting in national states such as Mexico.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n          Invasive species are a major driver of global biodiversity loss, hampering conservation efforts and disrupting ecosystem functions and services. While accumulating evidence has documented ecological impacts of invasive species across major geographic regions, habitat types and taxonomic groups, appraisals for economic costs have remained relatively sparse. This has hindered effective cost-benefit analyses that inform expenditure on management interventions to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species. Terrestrial invertebrates are a particularly pervasive and damaging group of invaders, with many species compromising primary economic sectors such as agriculture and health. The present study provides synthesised quantifications of economic costs caused by invasive terrestrial invertebrates on the global scale and across a range of descriptors, using the InvaCost database. Invasive terrestrial invertebrates reportedly cost the global economy US$ 1.26 trillion over the investigated period (1960–2020), mostly due to invasive insects (> 90%). Overall, costs were not equally distributed geographically, with North America (76%) reporting the greatest costs, with far lower costs reported in Europe (4%) Asia (4%), Africa (3%), South America (2%), and Oceania (1%). These costs mostly resulted from direct resource damages and losses (76%), particularly to agriculture and forestry; relatively little (4%) was invested in management. A minority of monetary costs was directly observed (43%), but costs were mostly sourced from highly reliable estimates (58%). Economic costs displayed an increasing trend with time, with an average annual cost of US$ 20.67 billion since 1960, but reporting lags reduced costs in recent years. The massive global economic costs of terrestrial invertebrates require urgent consideration and investment by policymakers and managers, in order to prevent and remediate the economic and ecological impacts of these and other invasive species groups.",

            "abstractNote": "Tree taxa are often planted beyond their native range to increase the provision of some ecosystem services. Yet, they can disrupt ecosystem processes in their new ranges, causing changes in the provision of other services. Here we review the effects of ﬁve widespread tree taxa (Acacia, Ailanthus, Eucalyptus, Pinus and Robinia) on six regulating ecosystem services in areas where they are non-native. We conducted a literature search for pairwise comparisons between sites dominated by any of the selected taxa and sites with native vegetation. An array of variables were used as indicators for each ecosystem service. Data were analysed using multi-level meta-analyses to compare effects of taxa on each ecosystem service, and effects of the same taxa across contexts. We compiled 857 case studies from 107 source papers. Several taxa tended to increase climate regulation, mostly Eucalyptus. Acacia decreased ﬁre risk prevention. Robinia, Acacia and Ailanthus increased soil fertility, while Eucalyptus and Pinus, tended to decrease it. Soil formation was enhanced by Robinia and Ailanthus. Acacia promoted the increase of water in land pools, while Eucalyptus tended to decrease them. All effects show a large heterogeneity across case studies. Part of this heterogeneity could be attributed to gross climatic differences (i.e. biome), to species differences within each genus, to the structure of the recipient ecosystem, and/or to human management. Managers and policy-makers should consider the context-dependency and the potential effects of non-native trees on a wide range of services to ground their decisions. Our analyses also revealed important gaps of knowledge (e.g. on ﬁre risk prevention, erosion control or water cycle regulation) and some potential publication bias. The methodology used here easily allows for future updates as new information will become available.",

            "abstractNote": "Several Prosopis species have been introduced into South Africa in the last century and many of them have become invasive. This study investigates the water relations, effects of clearing, and the seasonal dynamics of groundwater use by invasive Prosopis trees. The trees were growing on deep sandy soils in the ﬂoodplain of an episodic river in the arid Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Data were collected on tree water uptake, evapotranspiration and water table depth over different seasons. Effects of tree clearing on groundwater were quantiﬁed by comparing data from a Prosopis invaded and an adjacent cleared area. Transpiration rates were less than 1.0 mm/d throughout the year and the trees showed structural and physiological adaptations to the combined low rainfall and low water holding capacity of the soils by developing very narrow sapwood areas and by closing their stomata. The trees abstracted groundwater as evidenced by the decline in borehole water levels in the Prosopis stand before the rainy season. Groundwater savings of up to 70 m3/month could be achieved in spring for each hectare of Prosopis cleared. The study suggests that clearing of invasive Prosopis would conserve groundwater in the arid parts of South Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "In Europe, both Oriental plane and London plane trees are seriously threatened by the invasive fungal pathogen Ceratocystis platani (Walter) Engelbr. & T.C. Harr., the causal agent of canker stain disease (CSD) of plane trees. The fungus is considered to be indigenous to North America and was accidently introduced into Europe during World War II, where it continues to spread clonally. The impact of CSD in Europe can be compared with notorious tree diseases such as Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, and more recently Ash dieback, which have all caused devastating losses to natural woody ecosystems and ornamental trees. In Italy and France, C. platani has caused widespread mortality to London plane trees and the pathogen has also been recorded in Switzerland and Spain. However, the most dramatic impact of the disease has been in Greece in natural stands of Oriental plane. The objective of this feature article is to review current knowledge regarding CSD and to highlight the dramatic and devastating nature of the disease. An important aim is also to highlight the risk of C. platani spreading northward in Europe and eastward to Asia in the natural and cultivated range of oriental and London plane.",

There are four agents: goat owner, cattle owner, wood gatherer, and park manager. It is shown that there is an inherent trade-off between the number of tigers and village livestock that are grazing. Prosopis juliﬂora makes management of this trade-off more difﬁcult. The four agents have different interests in the park, and a different ranking of the four scenarios that are simulated.",

We studied changes in the composition of plant species and soil properties related to the invasion of P. hysterophorus in three grassland communities of central Nepal. We collected vegetation and soil data along transects that were established in densely invaded to non-invaded areas within homogenous grassland stands. We found signiﬁcant differences between invaded, transitional and noninvaded plots in species composition and soil properties. There were fewer species in non-invaded than transitional and invaded plots. By P. hysterophorus invasion both native and non-native species were supported or replaced, respectively. The concentrations of soil nitrogen and organic matter were signiﬁcantly higher in transitional and invaded plots than in non-invaded plots. Soil pH, phosphorus and potassium were highest in the invaded plots, lowest in the non-invaded and intermediate in the transitional plots. Due to changes in above-ground vegetation and below-ground soil nutrient contents, P. hysterophorus invasion is likely to have an overall negative effect on the functioning of the entire ecosystem. Therefore, management of noxious P. hysterophorus is necessary to prevent future problems.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions can cause substantial economic losses and expenses for management, as well as harm biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being. A comprehensive assessment of the economic costs of invasions is a challenging but essential prerequisite for efficient and sustainable management of invasive alien species. Indeed, these costs were shown to be inherently heterogeneous and complex to determine, and substantial knowledge gaps prevent a full understanding of their nature and distribution. Hence, the development of a still-missing global, standard framework for assessing and deciphering invasion costs is essential to identify effective management approaches and optimise legislation. The recent advent of the InvaCost database – the first comprehensive and harmonised compilation of the economic costs associated with biological invasions worldwide – offers unique opportunities to investigate these complex and diverse costs at different scales. Insights provided by such a dataset are likely to be greatest when a diverse range of experience and expertise are combined. For this purpose, an international and multidisciplinary workshop was held from 12\n              th\n              to 15\n              th\n              November 2019 near Paris (France) to launch several project papers based on the data available in InvaCost. Here, we highlight how the innovative research arising from this workshop offers a major step forward in invasion science. We collectively identified five core research opportunities that InvaCost can help to address: (i) decipher how existing costs of invasions are actually distributed in human society; (ii) bridge taxonomic and geographic gaps identified in the costs currently estimated; (iii) harmonise terminology and reporting of costs through a consensual and interdisciplinary framework; (iv) develop innovative methodological approaches to deal with cost estimations and assessments; and (v) provide cost-based information and tools for applied management of invasions. Moreover, we attribute part of the success of the workshop to its consideration of diversity, equity and societal engagement, which increased research efficiency, creativity and productivity. This workshop provides a strong foundation for substantially advancing our knowledge of invasion impacts, fosters the establishment of a dynamic collaborative network on the topic of invasion economics, and highlights new key features for future scientific meetings.",

            "abstractNote": "Biological invasions can dramatically impact natural ecosystems and human societies. However, although knowledge of the economic impacts of biological invasions provides crucial insights for efficient management and policy, reliable syntheses are still lacking. This is particularly true for low income countries where economic resources are insufficient to control the effects of invasions. In this study, we relied on the recently developed \"InvaCost\" database – the most comprehensive repository on the monetised impacts of invasive alien species worldwide – to produce the first synthesis of economic costs of biological invasions on the African continent. We found that the reported costs of invasions ranged between US$ 18.2 billion and US$ 78.9 billion between 1970 and 2020. This represents a massive, yet highly underestimated economic burden for African countries. More alarmingly, these costs are exponentially increasing over time, without any signs of abatement in the near future. The reported costs were mostly driven by damage caused by invaders rather than expenses incurred for management. This trend was highly skewed towards a few regions (i.e. Southern and Eastern Africa) and activity sectors (i.e. agriculture) and incurred by a small number of invasive taxa (i.e. mainly three insect pests:\n              Chilo partellus\n              ,\n              Tuta absoluta\n              ,\n              Spodoptera frugiperda\n              ). We also highlight crucial, large gaps in current knowledge on the economic costs of invasions that still need to be bridged with more widespread research effort and management actions across the continent. Finally, our study provides support for developing and implementing preventive measures as well as integrated post-invasion management actions at both national and regional levels. Considering the complex societal and economic realities in African countries, the currently neglected problem of biological invasions should become a priority for sustainable development.",

            "abstractNote": "Over the past decade, the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) has devoted considerable attention to the ecology of invasive organisms (e.g., Brockie et al. 1988; Loope et al. 1988; MacDonald and Frame 1988; MacDonald et al. 1988; Usher 1988; Drake et al. 1989). Conclusions emerging from the workshops that fostered these publications include: (1) perhaps most importantly — biological invasions are now recognized as a global phenomenon that can affect both structure and function in ecosystems; (2) even nature reserves, typically pieces of land set aside because they represent intact native species-dominated ecosystems, are subject to serious biological invasions; (3) island ecosystems typically have a higher representation of alien species in their flora and fauna than do mainland systems; and (4) the severity of invasions on islands increases with isolation of the island. The latter two conclusions are consistent with what has become dogma in discussions of invading species — that island communities are more invasible than mainland ones. Investigators have often expressed this viewpoint with statements such as “because it evolved in isolation, this native fauna [of islands] is highly susceptible to the introduction of alien species” (Richardson 1992). This statement does not distinguish between the possibilities that alien species might establish more readily on islands versus that alien species might have more of an effect (population, community level, etc.) on islands than they do on continents",

            "abstractNote": "With globalization, agriculture and aquaculture activities are increasingly affected by diseases that are spread through movement of crops and stock. Such movements are also associated with the introduction of non-native species via hitchhiking individual organisms. The oyster industry, one of the most important forms of marine aquaculture, embodies these issues. In Europe disease outbreaks affecting cultivated populations of the naturalized oyster Crassostrea gigas caused a major disruption of production in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mitigation procedures involved massive imports of stock from the species' native range in the northwestern Pacific from 1971 to 1977. We assessed the role stock imports played in the introduction of non-native marine species (including pathogens) from the northwestern Pacific to Europe through a methodological and critical appraisal of record data. The discovery rate of non-native species (a proxy for the introduction rate) from 1966 to 2012 suggests a continuous vector activity over the entire period. Disease outbreaks that have been affecting oyster production since 2008 may be a result of imports from the northwestern Pacific, and such imports are again being considered as an answer to the crisis. Although successful as a remedy in the short and medium terms, such translocations may bring new diseases that may trigger yet more imports (self-reinforcing or positive feedback loop) and lead to the introduction of more hitchhikers. Although there is a legal framework to prevent or reduce these introductions, existing procedures should be improved.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim A third of all modern (after 1500) mammal extinctions (24/77) are Australian species. These extinctions have been restricted to southern Australia, predominantly in species of ‘critical weight range’ (35–5500 g) in drier climate zones. Introduced red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) that prey on species in this range are often blamed. A new wave of declines is now affecting a globally significant proportion of marsupial species (19 species) in the fox-free northern tropics. We aim to test plausible causes of recent declines in range and determine if mechanisms differ between current tropical declines and past declines, which were in southern (non-tropical) regions. Location Australian continent Methods We used multiple regression and random forest models to analyse traits that were associated with declines in species range, and compare variables associated with past extinctions in the southern zones with current tropical (northern) declines. Results The same two key variables, body mass and habitat structure, were associated with proportion-of-decline in range throughout the continent, but the form of relationships differs with latitude. In the south, medium-sized species in open habitats of lower rainfall were most likely to decline. In the tropics, small species that occupy open vegetation with moderate rainfall (savanna) are now experiencing the most severe declines. Throughout the continent, large-bodied species and those in structurally complex habitats (rainforest) are secure. Main conclusions Our results indicate that there is no mid-sized ‘critical weight range’ in the north. Because foxes are absent from the tropics, we suggest that northern Australian marsupial declines are associated with predation by feral cats (Felis catus) exacerbated by reduced ground level vegetation in non-rainforest habitats. To test this, we recommend experiments to remove cats from some locations where tropical mammals are threatened. Our results show that comparative analysis can help to diagnose potential causes of multi-species decline.",

            "abstractNote": "In the past few years, two massive eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) devastations occurred in Lake Balaton, Hungary. In 1991, 300 tons of eel perished in the western basin of the lake, while in the summer of 1995 30 tons of eel died in the eastern part of the lake. Investigations carried out to find the causes of these ecocatastrophes included measurements of certain biochemical parameters: the blood sugar level, and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.2.3), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, EC 2.6.1.1) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT, EC 2.6.1.2) activities in the blood serum of the collected eels. In both 1991 and 1995, deltamethrin (DM), the active ingredient of the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV used against mosquitoes, was detected in the eels; in 1995 it was demonstrated in several other animal species, i.e., bream (Abramis brama L.), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca L.), and the common gull (Larus canus), and in sediment samples from the lake. Additionally, laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of DM on eels. In 1991, eels were collected from the western (the site of the devastation) and eastern basins of the lake. The eels from the eastern basin were used as controls. At that time, the AChE activity in the blood serum of the eels from the western basin was significantly inhibited compared to that in animals from the eastern basin (P < 0.05, Student t test). Eels from the western part of the lake had GOT and GPT levels 20 and 100%, respectively, higher than those of eels from the eastern part of the lake. The blood glucose level was much higher in the eels from the affected area of the lake as compared to those from the eastern part. The brain and liver of the eels contained DM residues at 20 micrograms/kg wet tissue (Gönczy, 1992). Gönczy suspected that one of the causes of the massive eel loss in 1991 was the presence of DM in the fish. In 1995, when the eel devastation occurred in the eastern basin, moribund and surviving eels were collected from this part of the lake. The AChE activity was significantly inhibited in the blood serum of the dying eels as compared to that in surviving animals (P < 0.05, Student t test). The blood glucose content exhibited a difference too: it was 2.5 times higher in the dying eels than in the surviving ones. A huge increase in the LDH level was measured in the dying eels, indicating damage to different muscle tissues to an extent never observed previously. The GOT activities of the serum were twice as high in the dying eels as in the living fish. The GPT was not significantly changed in the serum of dying eels as compared to the surviving animals. DM was detected in different tissue samples of the dying eels: 2.7-18.5 micrograms/kg in the liver, 9.0-31.1 micrograms/kg in the gill, and 3.0 micrograms/kg wet tissue in the muscle. DM residues were found in tissue samples from other animals, in the following concentrations: 0.4 micrograms/kg in bream, 2.1 micrograms/kg in pike perch, 1.1 micrograms/kg wet tissue in dead gulls. The sediment samples collected from different places and at different times contained DM in a concentration of 5.5-30.0 micrograms/kg wet sediment at the time of the eel deaths, while the sediment samples collected from the same places a month later still contained DM at 7.0-8.8 micrograms/kg wet sediment. Laboratory experiments with the insecticide K-OTHRIN 1 ULV revealed that 1.0 microgram/liter of its active ingredient, DM, caused the death of 50% of the eels after an incubation time of 96 hr. In the liver of the dead eels, DM was detected at 2.9-20.0 micrograms/kg wet tissue. All the above-mentioned changes and the DM residue detected in the eels appear to demonstrate the contribution of DM in the severe eel devastation. This finding on the ecological risk of such types of insecticides might be useful in their further application.",

The tunicate Pyura praeputialis, a recent invader in the Bay of Antofagasta, Chile, has monopolized the low and mid-low rocky intertidal fringe and apparently constrained the native mussel Perumytilus purpuratus to the mid-upper fringe. We performed field experiments to determine interspecific competitive strengths and quantify survival and growth rates between these species at 2 intertidal heights: mid-low and mid-upper intertidal fringes. Our results showed that at the mid-low fringe P. praeputialis had greater competitive strength than P. purpuratus. In fact, the survival and growth rates of P. praeputialis were not significantly affected by the presence of P. purpuratus. Further, while the survival of P. purpuratus was not significantly affected by the presence of P. praeputialis, its growth rate was affected by the degree of encroachment by the tunicate. Mussels encroached by P. praeputialis grew significantly less than non-encroached ones. At the mid-upper intertidal fringe, the survival of P. praeputialis was significantly decreased by the presence of P. purpuratus: the tunicate is unable to grow at this intertidal fringe. At the low-intertidal fringe mussel growth rates were significantly greater than at the mid-upper fringe, while survival rates were similar. Our results support the hypothesis that in the Bay of Antofagasta the invading tunicate P. praeputialis is responsible for a major rocky intertidal ecological impact, outcompeting the native mussel from the mid-low fringe and thereby substantially modifying the zonation pattern.",

However, information on trophic interactions, movements of fish, and variation in fish diet specialization between these habitats are scarce. The present study determined the trophic structure and the variation in diet composition of fish caught in (floating) seaweed farms, and in adjacent seagrass and coral reef habitats in Pongwe, Zanzibar. Fish were caught using traditional basket traps (dema) and gut contents of 392 fish were analyzed. A one-way Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) showed that there was a significant difference in the composition of prey items eaten by invertivores in different habitats (Global R = 0.109, p = 0.002.). There was no significant difference in the composition of prey items eaten by herbivores, invertivore-piscivores and omnivores (p > 0.05), likely due to movement of fish between these habitats for foraging. There was no significant difference in the relative proportion of trophic groups between the habitats (p > 0.05) except for herbivores (p < 0.05). Floating seaweed farms attract invertebrates and smaller fish, thus providing feeding grounds for predatory fish, and should be considered as ecologically important habitats as are coral reefs and seagrass beds.",

Macro-invertebrate biomass and numbers of feeding birds were measured on a Pacific oyster reef, an adjacent uncolonized mudflat, and an area of mudflat that had been cleared of oysters 6 months previously. These data were used to parameterize an individual-based model (MORPH) to predict the impact of clearance of the reef on winter bird survival. Feeding success and intake rates of Eurasian oystercatcher, Eurasian curlew, and Eurasian common redshank were also recorded during the course of a winter. The macro-invertebrate diversity and biomass within both the oyster reef and the cleared area were significantly greater than the adjacent uncolonized mudflat. The density and biomass of large invertebrate prey in the mudflat were low, yet the Pacific oyster reef had much higher densities and biomass of large prey, especially annelids and shore crabs. The winter assemblage of feeding birds differed significantly between each of the areas. The mean total number of feeding birds was significantly greater on the uncolonized mudflat; however, mean peak counts, feeding success rate and prey intake rate of Eurasian oystercatcher were greater on the reef. Significantly greater intake rates and feeding success rates were also observed on the reef for Eurasian curlew, a species of conservation concern. Field data and model predictions show that Pacific oyster reefs can provide valuable supplementary feeding areas for some shorebirds, yet other species avoided the reef. However, as estuaries vary in available feeding resources, it is important that the value of reefs and their management is determined regionally.",

            "abstractNote": "Many studies on invasive species show reduced native densities, but few studies measure trait-mediated effects as mechanisms for changes in native growth rates and population dynamics. Where native prey face invasive predators, mechanisms for phenotypic change include selective predation, or induced behavioral or morphological plasticity. Invasive green crabs, Carcinus maenas, have contributed to declines in native soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria, in coastal New England, USA. We tested the hypothesis that clam ability to detect chemical cues from predators or damaged conspecifics would induce greater burrowing depth as a refuge from invasive crabs, and greater burrowing would require increased siphon growth. To determine how crab predation affected clam survivorship and phenotypic traits in the field, clams in exclosure, open, and crab enclosure plots were compared. Crab predation reduced clam density, and surviving clams were deeper and larger, with longer siphons. To determine whether the mechanism for these results was selective predation or induced plasticity, phenotypes were compared between clams exposed to chemical cues from crab predation and clams exposed to seawater in laboratory and field experiments. In response to crab predation cues, clams burrowed deeper, with longer siphons and greater siphon mass. Overall, crab predation removed clams with shorter siphons at shallow depths, and crab predation cues induced greater burrowing depths and longer siphons. Longer siphons and greater siphon mass of deeper clams suggests clams may allocate energy to siphon growth in response to crabs. By determining native behavior and morphological changes in response to an invasive predator, this study adds to our understanding of mechanisms for invasive impacts and illustrates the utility of measuring trait-mediated effects to investigate predator–prey dynamics.",

Findings were similar at 20-21 degrees C and at 27-28 degrees C; at 27-28 degrees C, however, the fish required a higher oxygen content to survive.

            "abstractNote": "Field-based cultivation of Kappaphycus and Eucheuma seaweeds is widespread across the tropics and is largely done to extract the polysaccharide carrageenan, which is used in commercial applications. Although such seaweed farming has been cited as a sustainable alternative livelihood to destructive fishing, there has not been a comprehensive review of its environmental impacts to assess its potential conservation benefit. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and industry gray literature to determine what is known about seaweed farming techniques and their impacts on local ecosystems, organisms, and ecosystem services. We identified 43 tropical or subtropical countries that are currently cultivating or have cultivated carrageenophytes. Ecosystem impacts of seaweed farming were measured directly in 33 publications with variable results. Placement of seaweed farms above seagrass beds led to reduced productivity and shoot density in 5 studies and reduced or altered meiofaunal abundance and diversity in 6 studies. On coral reefs, overgrowth of corals by farmed seaweed species was documented in 8 cases. Two studies showed changes to herbivorous fish communities in adjacent areas because seaweed farms changed the environment, whereas in 2 studies measures of overall abundance or diversity did not change. The impacts of seaweed farming may not be as destructive as some other human activities, but they should still be considered when establishing new farms or managing existing farm sites. Our findings are consistent with suggestions to mitigate impact on local ecosystems by shifting seaweed farms to deeper, sandy-bottom areas. However, some of these changes may adversely affect farmers and associated communities.",

Between about 1870 and 1939 tens of millions of Crassostrea virginica were introduced from the Atlantic coast of North America. However, C. virginica has been unable to establish itself in Europe. For 5 other species it is very likely that they have been introduced with American oysters. Between 1964 and about 1980 C. gigas was imported on a large scale from Japan and the Pacific coast of Canada and the USA. It has established itself in Europe permanently. C gigas brought its own parasites and the imports were accompanied by the import of more than 20 species of animals. Most of these observed imports failed, however, and only about 5–6 species seem to have established themselves in European waters. As a vector for the introduction of exotic species into the North Sea area, oyster imports are slightly more important than transport on ship’s hulls, and clearly more important than introductions through ballast water. In the Dutch Oosterschelde estuary Japanese oysters interfere with the recreational use of the estuary because of their razor-sharp shells. They also seem to have changed the ecological conditions in the estuary: coinciding with the increase of the oysters, mussels and cockles decrease, as does the oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). It is not yet clear if this is a causal relationship. In the Wadden Sea near the island of Sylt, C. gigas established itself as an epibiont on mussel beds, and seems to be at the verge of transforming mussel beds into oyster reefs.",

They alter soil quality by mixing surface soils and trapping litter and water, leading to areas of increased decomposition of organic matter. The foraging pits of indigenous soil-disturbing animals tend to have different soil chemical characteristics, greater levels of infiltration and lower levels of soil density than adjacent areas. Enhanced capture of seeds and water turns disturbance pits into areas of enhanced plant germination. The burrows, pits and mounds of both native and exotic animals provide habitat for a range of vertebrates and invertebrates and contribute to patchiness in the landscape. Given their wide-ranging effects on surface soil and ecological processes, we argue in this review that soil disturbance by native animals has the potential to contribute to restoration of degraded landscapes, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Aim To investigate whether feral cats influence the distribution of Australia's largest remnant population of the threatened brush-tailed rabbit-rat Conilurus penicillatus and examine whether they influenced the extinction probability of C. penicillatus over a 15-year period (2000–2015). Location Melville Island, northern Australia. Methods In 2015, small mammal surveys were conducted at 88 sites across Melville Island, 86 of which had previously been surveyed in 2000–2002. We used single-season occupancy models to investigate correlates of the current distribution of C. penicillatus and dynamic occupancy models to investigate correlates of C. penicillatus local extinction. Results Our results show that C. penicillatus, which once occurred more widely across the island, is now restricted to parts of the island where feral cats are rarely detected and shrub density is high. Our results suggest that feral cats are driving C. penicillatus towards extinction on Melville Island, and hence have likely been a significant driver in the decline of this species in northern Australia more broadly. The impact of feral cats appears to be mitigated by vegetation structure. Main conclusions The ongoing development and implementation of methods to effectively reduce feral cat densities, coupled with the management of landscape processes to maintain shrub density, through fire management and the removal of large exotic herbivores, will contribute substantially to conserving this threatened species. This study demonstrates that the distribution of species can be strongly influenced by top-down factors such as predation, thereby highlighting the importance of including biotic interactions when investigating the distribution of predation-susceptible species.",

The overall recapture rate was 36%. The prevalence of infection was lowest at the northernmost sampling site. There were no significant differences between infected and uninfected A. anguilla in condition indices, body fat content and estimated migration speeds. Parasite infection intensity levels were significantly negatively correlated with times and distances covered between release and recapture, but did not correlate with migration speed. It appears that more heavily infected A. anguilla were relatively more vulnerable to recapture in pound nets. It is hypothesized that parasite-induced damage to the swimbladder inhibited vertical migrations and infected A. anguilla tended to migrate in shallower coastal waters, relatively close to the shore.",

The probability of reacting to, and rejecting, the velocity gradient was positively related to A. crassus larval, adult and total abundance. High abundance of Pseudodactylogyrus spp. reduced this effect, but A. crassus was the strongest parasitic factor associated with fish behaviour, and abundance was positively related to delay in downstream passage. Delayed downstream migration at hydraulic gradients associated with riverine anthropogenic structures could result in additional energetic expenditure for migrating A. anguilla already challenged by A. crassus infection.",

It was first detected at a harbour in Saldanha on the west coast and apparently arrived accidentally. From there, it spread at a rate of about 115 kmÁyearÀ 1 and now occupies the whole of the west coast of South Africa and at least the southern half of Namibia. It was deliberately introduced from the west coast to the south coast for mariculture. In this case study, we record its effects on intertidal rocky shores, cast in terms of predictions based on (a) the history of its invasions elsewhere, (b) its mode of dispersal, (c) its physiological performance relative to indigenous mussels, (d) the role of wave action as a moderator of competition, (e) the influence of relative body sizes, (f) the projected effects of the mussel on infauna, (g) consumption by higher trophic levels, and (h) rates of parasitism.",

            "abstractNote": "Reefs built by the annelid worm Sabellaria alveolata in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France) are the most extensive intertidal biogenic structures within Europe. Before and after mussel farming extensions, a study designed to provide a biological health index of the Sainte-Anne reef (223 ha) was carried in 2001 and 2007 to serve as an easy-to-use management tool and to ensure endangered reef portions were properly targeted and protected. Coupled physical and biological parameters were included in a spatial Health Status Index (HI). A spatial and temporal mapping survey of the HI showed a continuous deterioration of the reef's state of health, particularly in its central part. This degradation correlates with the colonization of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and with increasing silt deposits on the reef. A combination of several factors is likely to explain such rapid reef deterioration: (1) an increase in trophic competition between cultivated and wild suspension-feeders that is detrimental to the annelids; (2) a modification in the hydrodynamics and consequently in sedimentary patterns leading to an increase in silt deposition; and most importantly (3) an increase in recreational harvesting of oysters and associated reef trampling, resulting in reef fragmentation. Understanding the parameters that influence the reef dynamics is necessary in order to help efficient and effective management and policy focusing on the conservation status of large biogenic structures.

A further 21% of Australian endemic land mammal species are now assessed to be threatened, indicating that the rate of loss (of one to two extinctions per decade) is likely to continue. Australia’s marine mammals have fared better overall, but status assessment for them is seriously impeded by lack of information. Much of the loss of Australian land mammal fauna (particularly in the vast deserts and tropical savannas) has been in areas that are remote from human population centers and recognized as relatively unmodified at global scale. In contrast to general patterns of extinction on other continents where the main cause is habitat loss, hunting, and impacts of human development, particularly in areas of high and increasing human population pressures, the loss of Australian land mammals is most likely due primarily to predation by introduced species, particularly the feral cat,\n              Felis catus\n              , and European red fox,\n              Vulpes vulpes\n              , and changed fire regimes.",

Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfilthe requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophicecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding andprovide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps inknowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of thelevel of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects ofmodel formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispeciesand ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates thatthere is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and thatthere are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives someinsight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management,and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether somemodels can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendationis that the use of a single 'ultimate' ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatoryuse of multiple 'minimum-realistic' models is strongly recommended.",

            "abstractNote": "Temperate reefs host diverse fish communities along the southeast United States Atlantic coast (SEUS), yet the sustainable management of reef fishes faces myriad challenges. One challenge has been the introduction of Indo-Pacific lionfish (\n              Pterois volitans\n              /\n              miles\n              ; hereafter\n \"lionfish\"), which have spread quickly throughout the SEUS since their introduction in the late 1900s. We analyzed long- term (2001–2019) video data along the continental shelf break and upper slope (45–125 m deep) of the SEUS to assess changes in lionfish densities over time,\n characterize reef fish community structure, and determine if native reef fish community structure has changed due to lionfish. Lionfish densities increased substantially during the study, from zero individuals observed in 2001 to approximately 1.2 individuals observed per 100 m 3 (and present\n in all included transects) by 2019, yet no fish community metrics were negatively related to lionfish density. Demersal habitat influenced fish community structure more than any other variable examined, with more individuals and different fish communities occurring on high-relief compared\n to low-relief hardbottom habitats. The effects of latitude, depth, and bottom temperature on reef fish community structure were generally weak or nonexistent. Although previous empirical work has found that lionfish negatively affect native fishes at small scales (<30 km\n              2\n              ), it\n is unclear why we did not find similar results in our larger- scale study. It may be related to vagaries of the spatial scale of observation, lionfish effects being primarily limited to high- relief habitats, time lags, or lionfish densities not being high enough yet to cause observable ecological\n effects.",

We hypothesized that the availability of hard substrate and the amount of wave exposure would explain distribution patterns, and that higher abundance of herbivorous fishes in Tanzania would exert stronger top–down control than in Hawai’i. To address these hypotheses, we surveyed\n              E. denticulatum\n              in sites subjected to different environmental conditions and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to identify predictors of\n              E. denticulatum\n              presence. We also estimated grazing intensity on\n              E. denticulatum\n              by surveying the type and the amount of grazing scars. Finally, we used molecular tools to distinguish between indigenous and non-indigenous strains of\n              E. denticulatum\n              on Mafia Island. In Kane’ohe Bay, the likelihood of finding\n              E. denticulatum\n              increased with wave exposure, whereas on Mafia Island, the likelihood increased with cover of coral rubble, and decreased with distance from areas of introduction (AOI), but this decrease was less pronounced in the presence of coral rubble. Grazing intensity was higher in Kane’ohe Bay than on Mafia Island. However, we still suggest that efforts to reduce non-indigenous\n              E. denticulatum\n              should include protection of important herbivores in both sites because of the high levels of grazing close to AOI. Moreover\n              ,\n              we recommend that areas with hard substrate and high structural complexity should be avoided when farming non-indigenous strains of\n              E. denticulatum\n              .",

            "abstractNote": "The effects of invasive species on native fauna are understudied in marine ecosystems, even though the impact of introduced species must be taken into consideration for proper conservation and management. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of invasive algae on one of the highest diversity assemblages in the Mediterranean, the coralligenous. Two manipulative experiments were designed to study the effects of overgrowth of invasive species on juvenile colonies of the Mediterranean gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, an important structural species in coralligenous assemblages. The experiments were conducted in two French marine protected areas, Port-Cros National Park and Scandola Regional Park, which are separated by hundreds of km and are invaded by Caulerpa racemosa and Womersleyella setacea, respectively. Both invasive species had a strong and consistently negative effect on different components of fitness. This finding was demonstrated by lower survivorship, higher necrosis rates and lower biomass in P. clavata colonies exposed to invasive algal overgrowth compared to the controls. Because invasive species affected the viability of juvenile colonies of P. clavata, we conclude that the persistence of P. clavata populations affected by invasion can be jeopardized, especially in the case of populations already impacted by mass mortalities associated with climate warming.",

Results showed that assemblages strongly differed between invaded and reference areas in relation to both assemblage structure and species richness. Moreover, significant differences were detected between assemblages colonized by different invaders: C. racemosa var. cylindracea seemed to affect mostly encrusting organisms, while turf algae decreased in areas invaded by W. setacea.

            "abstractNote": "Biofouling can pose a significant threat to shellfish aquaculture, as fouling organisms are often strong spatial competitors that are able to reach high densities or biomass in relatively short time frames. This study investigated the potential impacts of the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum on cultured New Zealand green-lipped mussels Perna canaliculus at one farm in the Marlborough Sounds region. Three size classes of mussels were examined: small (20 to 40 mm shell length at deployment), medium (40 to 60 mm), and large (60 to 70 mm). Replicate 4 m mussel lines were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) ambient fouling, (2) fouling enhanced by D. vexillum fragment inoculation (in addition to ambient fouling), or (3) control lines that were kept free of D. vexillum. After 15 mo, subsections of lines (0.5 m length) were processed to determine the effects of fouling cover on mussel density within lines, as well as on individual mussel size and condition. A highly significant negative relationship was shown between D. vexillum biomass and mussel density for small mussels, and to a lesser extent for medium mussels. Values of mussel condition indices were similar across size classes and across fouling treatments within each size class. These results indicate that mussels may only be vulnerable to direct D. vexillum fouling impacts at early stages of production, and that impacts may be restricted to displacement of mussels as opposed to reduced size and condition. This information will assist in the implementation of management procedures through increased understanding of D. vexillum effects at different stages of mussel production.",

            "abstractNote": "Context. Invasive predators are a key threat to biodiversity worldwide. In Australia, feral cats are likely to be responsible for many extinctions of native mammal species in the south and centre of the continent. Aims. Here we examine the effect of feral cats on native rodent populations in the second of two translocation experiments. Methods. In a wild-to-wild translocation, we introduced pale field rats, Rattus tunneyi, whose populations are declining in the wild, into two pairs of enclosures where accessibility by feral cats was manipulated. Key results. Individual rats translocated into enclosures accessible to cats were rapidly extirpated after cats were first detected visiting the enclosures. Rats in the enclosure not exposed to cats were 6.2 times more likely to survive than those exposed to cats. Two individual cats were responsible for the deaths of all but 1 of 18 cat-accessible rats. Rats in the site with denser ground cover persisted better than in the site with more open cover. Conclusions. These results are consistent with our previous study of a different native rat species in the same experimental setup, and provide further evidence that, even at low densities, feral cats can drive local populations of small mammals to extinction. Implications. Effective feral cat control may be necessary to enable recovery of small mammals.",

The crucial factor in the bird&#39;s rapid disappearance between 1881 and 1890 appears to have been the successful liberation of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in 1879. This led to great increases of feral cats and introduced wekas (Gallirallus australis) and presumably to greatly intensified predation on parakeets.",

            "abstractNote": "The eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) is a medium-sized Australian marsupial carnivore that has recently undergone a rapid and severe population decline over the 10 years to 2009, with no sign of recovery. This decline has been linked to a period of unfavourable weather, but subsequent improved weather conditions have not been matched by quoll recovery. A recent study suggested another mechanism: that declines in Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations, due to the spread of the fatal Devil Facial Tumour Disease, have released feral cats (Felis catus) from competitive suppression, with eastern quoll declines linked to a subsequent increase in cat sightings. Yet current evidence of intraguild suppression among devils, cats and quolls is scant and equivocal. We therefore assessed the influences of top-down effects on abundance and activity patterns among devils, feral cats and eastern quolls. Between 2011 and 2013, we monitored four carnivore populations using longitudinal trapping and camera surveys, and performed camera surveys at 12 additional sites throughout the eastern quoll’s range. We did not find evidence of a negative relationship between devil and cat abundance, nor of higher cat abundance in areas where devil populations had declined the longest. Cats did not appear to avoid devils spatially; however, there was evidence of temporal separation of cat and devil activity, with reduced separation and increasing nocturnal activity observed in areas where devils had declined the longest. Cats and quolls used the same areas, and there was no evidence that cat and quoll abundances were negatively related. Temporal overlap in observed cat and quoll activity was higher in summer than in winter, but this seasonal difference was unrelated to devil declines. We suggest that cats did not cause the recent quoll decline, but that predation of juvenile quolls by cats could be inhibiting low density quoll populations from recovering their former abundance through a ‘predator pit’ effect following weather-induced decline. Predation intensity could increase further should cats become increasingly nocturnal in response to devil declines.",

The reintroduction of bilbies and bettongs into a reserve in central Australia provided an opportunity to compare their ecosystem impacts with those of two prevalent fossorial animals; the exotic European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the native sand goanna (Varanus gouldii). Bilbies and bettongs dug deeper and wider pits, excavating signiﬁcantly more soil than rabbits or goannas. Pit coverage was four-times greater, and signiﬁcantly more soil was excavated in the reserve where bilbies, bettongs and goannas were enclosed together compared with a site outside the reserve where rabbits and goannas co-occurred, or within the reserve where goannas occurred alone. Goannas dug fewer holes outside the reserve than in either of the reserve paddocks. Litter and viable seed were restricted almost exclusively to the pits, and soil from pits had higher levels of labile carbon than non-pit surface soils. Compared with surface soils, bilby, bettong and goanna pits contained relatively more labile carbon than rabbit pits. The signiﬁcantly greater soil excavation by the bilbies and bettongs, and higher concentrations of carbon in their pits, relative to rabbit and goanna pits, demonstrate that these reintroduced fossorial mammals play important roles in the creation of fertile patches in arid landscapes. The results suggest that the extirpation of Australia’s mammal fauna has been accompanied by a loss of key ecosystem processes.",

The effects of three seasons of hunting on characteristics of a feral cat population on sub-Antarctic Marion Island are evaluated. Hunting pressure fell mainly on adults, resulting in the population becoming progressively younger. Adult year-class age structures and sex ratios did not change, indicating that no adult group was particularly vulnerable to hunting. Proportions of females breeding and number of litters per female per year decreased, resulting in a decrease in mean fecundity. Lower fecundity is thought to be a consequence of lower encounter rates between males and females at lowered densities. Using several methods, estimates of population size varied greatly. The only real indication of the decrease in density was the drastic increase in the number of hours hunted at night per cat seen : from 1,3 h per cat at the start of the first season to 8,3 h by the end of the third season.\nDie uitwerking van drie jagseisoene op die eienskappe van &#39;n wilde huiskatbevolking op sub-Antarktiese Marioneiland word ge-evalueer. Die jag het druk hoofsaaklik op volwassenes uitgeoefen, wat daartoe gelei het dat die bevolking toenemend jonger geword het. Volwassenes se jaarklas-ouderdomstrukture en geslagsverhoudings het nie verander nie, wat aangedui het dat geen volwasse groep besonder kwesbaar vir jag was nie. Verhoudings van telende wyfies en aantal werpsels per wyfie per jaar het afgeneem, wat tot &#39;n afname in gemiddelde fekunditeit gelei het. Laer fekunditeit word beskou as &#39;n gevolg van die laer kontaktempo tussen mannetjies en wyfies by laer digthede. Die gebruik van verskeie metodes om bevolkingsgrootte te bepaal het tot groot variasie in bevolkingsskattings gelei. Die enigste werklike aanduiding van die afname in digtheid was die drastiese toename in die aantal ure gejag in die nag per kat gesien : vanaf 1,3 h per kat by aanvang van die eerste seisoen tot 8,3 h teen die einde van die derde seisoen.",

The cat is one of the most controversial invasive species in the Pacific region because of its complex relations with humans. At one extreme, well-fed domestic house pets are allowed outdoors where they may hunt native animals; at the other, unsocialized feral cats have replaced native predators as apex predators or occupy a new niche on oceanic islands, where they have devastated native faunas. In the middle are stray cats that are still socialized around humans. Feral and stray cats can be reservoirs of diseases that infect free-roaming domestic cats, humans, and wildlife. Given these problems, the best response would be to keep domestic cats indoors, restrict cat breeding, and remove feral populations. However, most Pacific basin societies have failed to reach a consensus on the cat problem, so solutions are ad hoc, often lacking in any scientific basis, and reflect our conflicting views. Compromise management might best fall into three broad classes: (1) eradication of cats should be confined to islands and other areas of high native biodiversity where reintroduction can be prevented; (2) in a landscape of low or moderate biological value, efforts should be made to educate the public to reduce the impact of their cats on remaining wildlife, while excluding cats from “islands” of elevated biodiversity values or human sensitivity; (3) in drastically simplified urban ecosystems, management perhaps should occur only in response to local complaints.",
