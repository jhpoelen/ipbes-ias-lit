An emerging infectious disease is one that either has appeared and affected a population for the first time, or has existed previously but is rapidly spreading, either in terms of the number of people getting infected, or to new geographical areas. Many EIDs are zoonotic in origin, which means that the disease has emerged from an animal and crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Nipah virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and avian influenza A(\u200eH5N1)\u200e are examples of diseases that have recently emerged and have affected the WHO South-East Asia Region. Often humans may have little or no natural immunity to EIDs, so their impact, on health, society and the economy, are difficult to predict. This publication, developed by the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, is intended to serve as a reading source of key facts for non-technical persons who are interested in public health, such as policy-makers, non-health officials, media persons as well as the general public. It contains key information on 26 selected endemic, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses affecting countries in the Region, or posing a potential threat to the Region. Each chapter starts with a general description of the type and severity of the infectious disease and how it is transmitted and spread, followed by an explanation of the risk factors for and symptoms of infection in humans. This is followed by recommendations on prevention, control and treatment.
